The natural phenomenon found reflection in culture, particularly in adventure literature. The earliest known example of \"cave behind the waterfall\" trope in culture is Icelandic Grettis saga \u00c1smundarsonar, composed approximately in late 14th century.[2][3] In the saga, murderous giants live in a cave behind a waterfall. Another early example is the Hawaiian myth of the goddess Hina, who according to the legend, lived in the cave behind Rainbow Falls on the Big Island.[4] In 1592 Chinese novel Journey to the West Sun Wukong discovers a cave after jumping through a large waterfall, with him and his monkey clan later moving into that cave.[5] In literature, the trope appears in Prisoners of the Sun (1948), The Lord of the Rings (1954) and Jurassic Park (1990) among other books. In Batman comics, one of the entrances to Batman's cave lies behind a waterfall. The trope appears in The Road to El Dorado, The Incredibles, Last of the Mohicans, The Mask of Zorro and other films. In the 1995 film Behind the Waterfall, a cave hidden behind a waterfall is a key plot part. Video Games The earliest known example of a location hidden behind a waterfall in video games is action-adventure video game The Legend of Zelda, released in February 1986.

Reception The 2021 release film was generally positive reviews as a lost curio, with many noting the film's many bizarre choices, soft-focus photography and low-budget special effects. The Verge[2] said the film \"is a riot of low-budget special effects, bizarre camera work, and Soviet mood music\" that \"captures a completely legitimate aspect of The Lord of the Rings, just not one we\u2019re necessarily used to.\" Others, such as The Guardian[3] called the film \"schlocky\" but would \"scratch a nostalgic itch for many who watched it.\" Online Reception The release of the film on YouTube inspired many conversations and memes on the internet. On April 6th, 2021, for example, Redditor shared a four-panel meme featuring some of the characters from the film in the /r/lotrmemes[4] subreddit.

Impressed by his work, anonymous /his/ users asked him to make more reconstructions, of various other historical figures. As Tomasi posted more reconstructions, he answered a few questions about himself, and when other users asked him about Canadian cinematographer Daniel Voshart[2], Tomasi expressed his disdain for him and his ROMAN EMPEROR PROJECT[3], calling him a \"canadian cuck\" and \"an afro-centrist idiot\" who, unlike himself, was good at self-advertising. Tomasi then linked his Twitter account[4], stating that he was just getting started on the site.     In the thread, as an anonymous user questioned Voshart's Afrocentrism, another user posted evidence of him considering various Roman emperors \"Black\", and using that to push his political agenda (shown below).

On /his/, Tomasi stated that he frequents a classical arts academy, and does these reconstructions for fun during his free time. In the interview with Bored Panda, he explained that he has always been interested in history, Greco-Roman and Phoenician history, in particular, and that he launched this little facial reconstruction project after seeing others do it online. He also stated  \u201cI decided to start doing these reconstructions after coming across other reconstructions on the internet, which have obviously been done by people with absolutely no knowledge about genetics or history. Other than the fact that it is very interesting for me to bring busts to life, the main reason I started making them is basically a response to the other historically inaccurate ones I saw.\"  He also stated  \u201cI would say the biggest challenge is trying to find the right bust to work from. I always try to find busts made during the lifetime of the person I am reconstructing the face of when I can, to be as accurate as possible.\u201d  Bored Panda's article revealed that Hannibal Barca seemed to be his favorites work at that point, and also enjoyed how his reconstruction of Cicero turned out.

According to MEL Magazine's[2] Miles Klee, \"Dudes Rock\" originated as a semi-ironic means of subverting the \"boys will be boys\" trope that was harshly criticized during the #MeToo movement, writing:  As a fledgling in-joke, \u201cdudes rock\u201d was a convenient way to satirize unprovoked, red-pill-type machismo -- observing Mother\u2019s Day by noting the supremacy of dudes, for example. But it also quickly became a shorthand for owning up to activities that, while not explicitly bad, feel intrinsically or even embarrassingly dude-like, from gaming for hours on end to growing a neckbeard to cracking open a cold one with the boys. While inundated with stories about awful, predatory men, you could still look at your unsheeted mattress and say to yourself: dudes rock.                     Spread The phrase quickly became an in-joke amongst the Chapo Trap House hosts, and by extension, their fandom. On September 10th, 2018, hosts Will Menaker and Matt Christman[3] had an exchange on Twitter where they both voiced \"dudes rock\" (shown below, left). On October 12th, the podcast E1[4] devoted an episode to defining \"Dudes Rock,\" coming up with definitions such as, \"Dude excellence is to me is like when I post a selfie, I think I\u2019m looking fresh when I\u2019m coming out of the 7-Eleven with like eight bags of Nacho Cheese Doritos -- I post a selfie, and any girls who fave that? Block all of \u2019em.\"     The phrase continued seeing use over the following several years, as people began associating it with memes and news stories. For example, on January 24th, 2019, Twitter user @bobby posted a Video Games Appeal To The Male Fantasy using the phrase, gaining over 240 retweets and 1,500 likes (shown below, top). On April 4th, 2021, Twitter user @infinitsummer[5] used the phrase in reference to a Reddit post asking why so many guys came to help the user dig a hole, gaining over 8,800 retweets and 115,000 likes (shown below, bottom).

There has been numerous faces that have appeared on the computer, including the trollface, and others that could possibly look like the baby version of trollface himself.

Twitter user kissythetimes[4] tweeted conjecture and evidence supporting the theory.

She has had 10 carts filled with fruits and churros confiscated by the police in the last 5 months.  - Next, we will distribute the remaining  funds to any street vendor who sells food or merchandise in NYC and has had their wares confiscated by police \u2013 vendors like Maria, who was arrested at Myrtle-Wyckoff station just 3 days after Elsa.   - Finally, we hope \"The Elsa Fund\" will continue to grow beyond the target goal, and become an ongoing fund to support vendors in recuperating their losses \u2013 as we fight to change the system.

During the first leaders debate which saw Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn participate, the Conservative Party's Press Office account rebranded to \"FactCheckUK\", pretending to be a fact checking service with aim to scruntise Jeremy Corbyn.     It later emerged after the debate that the account was found out to be used by the Conservative Party who continued using the @CCHQ handle on Twitter.                    Reaction Mainstream media After the revelation that it was a stunt by the Conservative Party, many media outlets such as BBC News, Sky News, the Independent and more reported on the story. BBC News presenter Emily Maitlis interviewed Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly on the accusations and asked why the party did so on one such occasion.      Twitter Twitter had responded to the situation shortly after the controversy had risen higher. Twitter said the Conservative Party had misled the public and it would take \u201cdecisive corrective action\u201d if a similar stunt was attempted again: \u201cTwitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cWe have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts. Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information \u2013 in a manner seen during the UK election debate \u2013 will result in decisive corrective action.\u201d Public reaction In reaction to the controversy, the hashtag \"#FactCheckGate\" began trending on Twitter with hundreds of tweets being posted shortly after the debate and the next day as well. Several accounts with verified ticks changed their username and profile picture to mimick the original stunt by the Conservative Party, and some were blocked on Twitter. Political parties The Conservative Party responded to the criticism saying that the British public wouldn't have been fooled in the first place. The Liberal Democrats called on the Electoral Commission to intervene after the incident.

At the time of its release, the song had received a mixed to negative reception with people considering it one of the worst songs in gaming history.[1]                     Spread Lankyposting (HE)    Lankyposting, also known as HE, refers to the practice of posting images of Lanky Kong, a character from the 1999 video game Donkey Kong 64. The practice itself began as a way of satirizing fan hype for potential playable characters in the Super Smash Brothers series by requesting that the supporting character should be included on the roster of the fourth installment. On August 14th, 2014 a 4chan user coined the term \"Lankyposting\" in a thread about the video game character. On September 6th, Tumblr user nicocw posted a photoshopped image of Lanky Kong in front of an inspirational quote background reciting his verse in the \"Donkey Kong Rap,\" which gained over 4,500 notes in three weeks (shown below).   Coconut Gun  The Coconut Gun is a weapon used by Donkey Kong in the game, which is described in the rap saying, \"His coconut gun can fire in spurts. If he shoots ya, it's gonna hurt!\" The line was named the fourth worst game line ever in the January 2002 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly. The line has become popularized by YouTuber SiIvaGunner who posted a video called \"DK Rap (Unused Version)\" which specifically parodies the line.  YouTuber SGNRyan posted a video in which every noun in the rap is replaced by the word \"coconut gun.\" Another YouTuber, Snooplax uploaded a video in which every model from the rap is replaced with a different model from the game.     brentalfloss Parody In 2018, music channel brentalfloss released a parody of the DK Rap titled \"DK RAP 2018 (\"Where Are They Now?\")\" which depicts the Kongs after the events of Donkey Kong 64. One of the memorable lines of the video, \"And then there's Chunky, he's dead,\" showing the character Chunky Kong dead.      #ExpandSong In January of 2019, a hashtag on Twitter called \"#ExpandSong\"[2] due to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate only having a shortened version of the song that featured the verses for Donkey Kong, Tiny Kong, and Diddy Kong and lacks the verses for Lanky Kong, Chunky Kong, and Cranky Kong. Fans started a campaign by spreading the hashtag to get the song in its entirety released in Smash.

Less than one year later, United States President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law.[1][2] Developments Google Settlement On September 4th, 2019, the Federal Trade Commission announced that Google and YouTube would pay a $170 million settlement for allegations that YouTube channels had collected personal information without parental consent. They wrote, \"The settlement requires Google and YouTube to pay $136 million to the FTC and $34 million to New York for allegedly violating the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Rule. The $136 million penalties is by far the largest amount the FTC has ever obtained in a COPPA case since Congress enacted the law in 1998.\"[3] In November 2019, the company announced changes to YouTube to comply with the law, requiring they properly label videos children's content. If creators fail to make the changes, YouTube creators may be fined up $42,000 for mislabeled videos.[4] According to the Verge,[5] \"The ruling means YouTube can\u2019t employ its powerful ad-targeting system on anyone who might be under the age of 13 -- a dire problem for a platform with so many young users.\" On November 12th, 2019, the YouTube Creators channel published a video on the new regulations. The post received more than 1.3 million views (shown below).  Criticism Some YouTube creators loudly denounced the change, primarily because certain videos and topics that they believe do not target children are being affected. Collectible toy reviewer Dan Eardley told the Verge,[5] \"Creators are being held directly responsible by the FTC. So if the FTC decides that [we] are indeed targeting children, we\u2019ll be fined.

For example, on November 13th, user @Dan_OMara posted a clip from Seinfeld parodying the Astros, gaining over 9,200 retweets and 40,000 likes (shown below, top).

It issued the maximum $5 million fine to the Astros and suspended Astros manager A.J. Hinch and General Manager Jeff Lunhow for a year. The team also lost several draft picks in future seasons.[4] Both men were fired shortly after the announcement. Alex Cora, who worked as Astros bench coach in 2017, was found to be a key player in the scandal and resigned from his position as Red Sox manager, though a suspension for him has yet to be announced. New York Mets manager Carlos Beltran, who played for the Astros in 2017, also parted ways with his team. Altuve Allegations On January 16th, a Twitter account claiming to belong to Carlos Beltran's niece alleged that Astros players were wearing buzzers that alerted them to what pitches were coming in the 2019 season, though the Beltran family denied that the account was related to them.[5] Jose Altuve and Josh Reddick were two players identified as behaving suspiciously after the Astros won the American League pennant. In particular, a clip of Altuve approaching home plate after hitting the series-ending walk-off home run in the American League Championship Series appears to show Altuve telling his teammates not to rip off his jersey. When asked about the moment at the time, Altuve said he would get in trouble with his wife if his shirt was ripped off.  Here\u2019s the clip of Altuve screaming at his teammates not to rip his jersey off including audio from the interview with Ken_Rosenthal</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/y7Lv76QFpX\">pic.twitter.com/y7Lv76QFpX</a></p>&mdash; \u064b (NYYDJ2) January 14, 2020   Reddick was accused of having a buzzer attached to him as well, as shots of him from a post-game interview appear to show a piece of tape on his chest. However, it appears to be confetti from the celebration.

They were shocked and acted out. I didn't know if I should share it/how to share this and was stressing out about it but at this point it doesn't matter I'm too sick and tired.  Needless to say I'm probably going to take a short break from streaming. I know people want to continue speculating but at the very least, please don't spread any more hurt to anyone. I am already heartbroken. I still love and care about my friends and Albie very much. That day, Redditors discussed the matter on r/offlinetv.[6] Redditor matthewo posted a photo of Lily and suggested a appreciation thread which gained over 7,100 points (93% upvoted) in five days (shown below, right).     On November 10th, @Fedmyster tweeted, \"On behalf of the OTV + friends group, I\u2019d like apologize for our very irresponsible and emotional response to yesterday\u2019s events. We were all pretty torn and upset for lily and going to social media was not the right move. Please continue to send her love during this time\" to which @pokimanelol[7] responded \"I'd like to add on & say I completely agree, at the time I did not think my actions would signal to others that it's okay to talk about this publicly, because it's not, and I'm sorry for that. I've apologized to Lily privately, because I want her feelings to be our priority\u2665\ufe0f\" (shown below, left). On November 11th, Twitch streamer Dr. Disrespect[14] welcomed Albert to the Champions Club unaware of the situation between the two streamers and just welcoming a viewer named Albert after he paid him. The clip garnered over 469,900 view in three days. Since then AlbertCD emotes have been created.[13] On November 12th, @THEalbertchang[8] tweeted an apology (shown below, right) which accumulated over 14,100 likes and 1,100 retweets in three days. The apology in Twitlonger[9] read: I\u2019m sorry. I made the worst decision of my life. I chose to be unfaithful to Lily, and caused her an excruciating amount of pain. I\u2019m incredibly sorry for my selfish and irredeemable behavior. I betrayed her trust and love for me, and for that, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to atone for it. I\u2019ll be taking an indefinite hiatus from content creation to reflect and spend some time alone.  I'm sorry for the people I've hurt in all of our communities, I'm sorry for the friends I let down at Offline.TV, and most of all I'm sorry for hurting you, Lily.     That day Lilypichu[10] responded by tweeting \"Take care & be safe\" which received over 23,000 likes and 800 retweets in three days (shown below, left). Finally on November 13th, @avocadopeeled[11] issued an apology through Twitter (shown below, right) which gained 800 likes in two days. The apology in Twitlonger[12] read: I'm sorry. No one deserves the level of pain I caused, especially not Lily: someone who has only shown me kindness. My choices were immensely selfish, and the levels of betrayal go beyond repair. She does not deserve to suffer like this. Nothing I write could ever be enough, nothing I say could possibly change anything. It will never be enough. There is only reparation in who I choose to be from here on out.  I will be taking time away from the public for self-reflection.  I'm sorry for the extreme hurt I've caused to everyone in the communities, to those who I could once call 'friend', and to Lily most of all.  I'm so sorry.

YouTube's Biggest Lie On September 29th, 2019, Nerd City released the video \"Youtube's Biggest Lie.\" In the video, Nerd City reported the findings from a study conducted, which revealed that YouTube demonetized any video that contained LGBTQ related words regardless of context.

Jake Paul Videos On September 1st, 2018, Nerd City published a video entitled \"PARENTS' WORST NIGHTMARE: Jake Paul.\" In the video, Nerd City accuses YouTuber Jake Paul of exploiting his young fanbase. He also asserts that the content is \"illegal to broadcast in the U.S., U.K. and E.U.\"  One year later, the Federal Trade Commission issued a fine of $170 million against Google for violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires a minor received a parent or guardian's permission before using the service.[1] Following the announcement, some online blamed Nerd City for the update. Twitter[2] user @InternetUnwind pushed back against this reading of situation. They said, \"Im still confused as to why people are going after nerdcity as if this happening is his fault. As far as i can see jake paul and nerd havent been mentioned by anyone official in this entire thing. This happened because ryans toy reviews was heavily advertising and not being clear\" (shown below, left). On November 12th, the YouTube Creators channel published a video about complying with COPPA.

They say that this content will effect YouTubers monetization. \"From January, we will limit the data that we collect on Made for Kids content to comply with the law,\" they say in the video. \"This means that we will disable personalised ads on this content (which affects revenue for creators making content for children), as well as certain features like comments, notifications and others.

Cherry's cohost Roger MacClean tweeted apologies for Cherry's remarks, writing, \"I see hockey as part of what unites us. I have the honour of travelling across our country to celebrate Canada's game, and our diversity is one of our country's greatest strengths\" (shown below). Cherry did not offer an apology for his comments, stating, \"I have had my say,\" though he later said if he could have the moment back, he would have said \"everyone\" instead of the phrase \"you people.\"    Cherry was then fired by Sportsnet.[3] This led to a counter-backlash from those supportive of Cherry, a group that included hockey legend Bobby Orr. Orr stated, \"What they've done to him up there is disgraceful. It really is.\" User @RossMcLeanSec wrote in defense of Cherry not kowtowing and reading \"liberal talking points\" like MacClean did (shown below). The Ringer[4] wrote that Cherry's firing was long overdue, citing several other controversial remarks Cherry had made in the past.

The Daily Northwestern is an independent, student-run publication. As the dean of Medill, where many of these young journalists are trained, I am deeply troubled by the vicious bullying and badgering that the students responsible for that coverage have endured for the \u201csin\u201d of doing journalism. Like those student journalists, I, too, have been approached by several student activists who were angered by the fact that they and their peers were depicted on the various platforms of The Daily engaged in the very public act of protesting the Sessions speech. I have explained to those activists that as Northwestern\u2019s--and the city of Evanston\u2019s--principal paper of record, The Daily had an obligation to capture the event, both for the benefit of its current audience as well as for posterity.

This particular collaboration was created exclusively with Illana and inspired by our previous campaigns. No other artists were approached for this project. The campaign also features not only doubles but also three or four Illanas to really underscore the campaign's theme, which is literal self-care.  Also, we'd like to assure you that the project out to you about in April was exclusive regarding an editorial contribution and did not involve this campaign or any other product campaign in any way. We respect you as an artist and would never copy your work or anyone else's without giving proper credit.

I\u2019m a firm believer that movie theaters need to be around forever.\" Spielberg continued, in what many believe was a criticism of Netflix:[2] I love the opportunity. Some of the greatest writing being done today is for television, some of the best directing for television, some of the best performances [are] on television today. The sound is better in homes more than it ever has been in history but there\u2019s nothing like going to a big dark theatre with people you\u2019ve never met before and having the experience wash over you.

You certainly, if it\u2019s a good show, deserve an Emmy, but not an Oscar. I don\u2019t believe films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.\" The 2019 series of comments, however, were perceived to be in response to the awards success of the film Roma, which Netflix produced and received three Academy Awards.                    Developments The speech was followed by reports that a group of people within the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, led by Spielberg, the Academy directors branch governor, would attempt to change awards contention rules that would block Netflix from participating.[4] Netflix's Response On February 28th, 2019, Netflix's official Twitter account posted a video about how Netflix was offering opportunities to artists, writers and filmmaker who otherwise might not have their \"stories told.\" The tweet, which many perceived as a response to Spielberg, received more than 15,000 retweets and 46,000 likes in three weeks.

The first post submitted to the site indicated that Shiba confessions would be \"a chance to put funny text in Comic Sans over unrelated pictures of Shibas.\"[7]      As this style of image grew in popularity, people began referring to these dogs as \"shibes,\" an intentionally incorrect variation on the word \"shiba.\" Other blogs using the word \"shibe\" launched at this time, including the now-defunct \"shibe-doge\" Tumblr.[8] On November 30th, the /r/shibe subreddit launched.[9] Within seven years, the group has amassed more than 23,000 readers. The following year, Urban Dictionary [10] user Le Eagle defined \"shibe\" as \"an internet meme revolving around Shiba Inus. There are usually captions written in Comic Sans describing what the 'shibe' is doing.\" The post received more than 200 upvotes in six years (shown below).

Criticisms On March 1st 2013, Journalist Karen Swallow Prior wrote a peice for The Atlantic[4] entitled \"The End of Women's History Month\" that denouced the passive engagement in womens history that happens year around and the annual celebration that \"bestows marks, yet also perpetuates, their marginalization.\" On March 8th, 2016, writer Mari Brighe wrote a piece for Bustle[2] that detailed her personal experience as a trans woman during Women's History Month and the lack of inclusivity. Similarly, in 2017 writer Barbara Sostaita wrote a piece for Huffington Post[3] about white feminism and the need to honor women of color. On March 23rd, 2018, Time Magazine[5] published an online article written by Nancy Goldstone entitled \"I'm a Historian, and I Think Women's History Month Is a Mistake.\" She writes that,  \"by allowing women to be shunted off to the side in this way -- for no matter how impressive the academic department, or how large the museum, or how many previously unknown females are highlighted in the month of March, that is what we are doing -- we ensure that women remain a subset of history rather than integral components of recognized major events.\" #WomensHistoryMonth On March 1st, 2019, the hashtag #WomensHistoryMonth began trending on Twitter. Twitter users began posting about events related to the month, shoutouts to importnt women, and reminders to celebrate marginalized groups of women.

Responses to the trailer were mixed. One of the most common complaints about the trailer was the design of the Pok\u00e9mon Jigglypuff, who is given fur in the film. Fans were divided on the decision, as some fans thought it didn't look correct to the character, while others said the alternative would be to make Jigglypuff all-skin, which could look disturbing.     Ryan Reynold's performance of the title character also received mixed reactions. Twitter user @Tatiannanow tweeted their confusion at the choice, gaining over 25 retweets and 310 likes (shown below, left). Other users expressed similar bewilderment at Reynolds and the project as a whole.

Polygon video producer Simone de Rochefort tweeted positively about the film (shown below, left).

The game takes place in an all-new area dubbed the Galar region. The game features a return to the \"gym\" method of progression, which was absent in Sun and Moon. The Pok\u00e9mon Company described Galar thus:  Galar is an expansive region with diverse environments -- an idyllic countryside, contemporary cities, thick forest, and craggy, snow-covered mountains. The people and the pok\u00e9mon who live there work together closely to develop the industries in the region. Fans will have the opportunity to visit various gyms in the Galar region in their quest to become champion.  The Direct introduced the generation's three starter Pok\u00e9mon: Grookey, the Grass type; Scorbunny, the Fire type; and Sobble, the Water type.    Online, fans quickly remarked upon the content of the first trailer, namely the designs of the new Pok\u00e9mon and how Galar appeared to be based on the United Kingdom. User @androssety pointed out that the Galar region looked like the UK if it was flipped upside down, gaining over 90 retweets (shown below, left). Twitter user @TBSkyen joked that the villains of the game would be pro-Brexit, gaining over 30 retweets and 70 likes (shown below, right).     Scorbunny generated excitement in particular. Fans quickly suggested the Pok\u00e9mon's evolutionary line would make its type Fire/Fighting, a popular trope amongst Pok\u00e9mon fans since the frequent type combination for fire starters was introduced in the third generation. Fanart referencing this was created by Twitter users 0503090s and seiryuuden (shown below, respectively first and second image), gathering respectively over 9,500 and 18,500 likes in less than 24 hours. Additionally, Scorbunny's bunny design quickly lead to fans associating it with the Big Chungus meme. Big Chungus variations by Tumblr user Witchtaunter and Twitter user @Nagrolaz (shown below, respectively third and fourth image) respectively gathered over 70 notes and 7,400 retweets in a similar time.       Sobble also managed to gather a lot of attention, as fans gravitated towards both the character's design and demeanor. User MFKAOZ joked the character was reminiscent of You Know I Had to Do It To 'Em, gaining over 110 retweets (shown below, left). User @defensebench posted art of Sobble, gaining over 150 retweets and 250 likes (shown below, right).     Pok\u00e9mon Gun Following the reveal of the subtitles as Sword and Shield, many fans jokingly speculated a third version would have the title Pok\u00e9mon Gun. Pok\u00e9mon games in the main series are known for always splitting new games into 2 versions with minor differences since the first generation. A completed third version is often released at a later date, although this hasn't appeared since generation V. The first popular tweet mentioning Pok\u00e9mon Gun was created by Twitter user @Sir5000 (shown below, left) and gathered over 17,500 retweets and 47,250 likes within 24 hours. Following the tweet, other fans soon followed with similar jokes and fanart. Versions by Tumblr user Circateas and Twitter user @ScruffyTurtles (shown below, right and bottom) managed to gather respectively over 31,000 notes and 43,000 likes.       June 5th Nintendo Direct On June 5th, 2019, Nintendo held another Direct focused on the upcoming games (shown below).  In the Direct, members of the development team introduced several new Pok\u00e9mon, characters, and game mechanics that will be present in Sword and Shield. The new Pok\u00e9mon introduced were Gossifleur, its evolution Eldegoss, Wooloo, Corviknight, Drednaw, and the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Zacian and Zamazenta. New characters include the champion Leon, his younger brother Hop, who will be the player-character's rival, Professor Magnolia, and her assistant Sonia.[2] The major new mechanic announced for the game, called \"Dynamax\", allows Pok\u00e9mon to become giant and super-powerful for three attacks. It can be used once per battle. Also announced was the \"Max Raid\" feature, in which players will use co-op to take on a giant Pok\u00e9mon together and capture it. Other gameplay details include a moveable camera and weather effects that affect the appearance of wild Pok\u00e9mon. The game will see a global release on November 15th, 2019. Fan art for the new Pok\u00e9mon and characters quickly followed the Direct. Twitter user @pankendev[3] posted art of Wooloo, gaining over 100 retweets and 200 likes in an hour (shown below, left). User @bkub_comic[4] posted art in the Pop Team Epic style, gaining over 6,100 retweets and 12,000 likes (shown below, right).

This included the introduction of new characters and the announcement of a playable demo of the game at the expo. Nessa Nessa is a gym leader set to appear in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield. After her cameo in the Nintendo Direct for E3 2019, she quickly developed a massive fandom, as fans created memes and fan art about the character, similar to their response to Sonia.       Yamper During the Nintendo Treehouse E3 Presentation, which included a playable Sword and Shield demo, fans were introduced to Yamper, an electric-type Pok\u00e9mon modeled after a corgi.[8] Serebii[9] tweeted its Pok\u00e9dex information, which reads \"If the Pok\u00e9mon is not holding an item, it will fetch the Poke Ball from the first failed throw of the battle.\" The Pok\u00e9mon was a fast favorite of fans, who appreciated its cute design, particularly a heart-shaped tuft of fur on its butt. User @TAHK0 tweeted his excitement, gaining over 41,000 retweets and 122,000 likes (shown below, left). User @pasteldogg tweeted fan art of the Pok\u00e9mon expressing that they hoped its evolutions would be just as cute, gaining over 4,400 retweets and 10,000 likes (shown below, right).     Expansion Pack Announcements On January 9th, 2020, the Pok\u00e9mon company held a Nintendo Direct in which the company announced Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX, a Switch remake of the 2006 Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team games, and expansion packs for Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, titled \"The Isle of Armor\" and \"The Crown Tundra.\"  The expansion passes will expand to new areas outside the Galar region, and players will be able to enter the areas using their current save file. Both areas will have areas that operate similar to the \"Wild Area\" in the base game. In the Direct, Game Freak clarified that these expansions will take the place of the traditional altered versions of the base game like Pok\u00e9mon Platinum, Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Moon, and Pok\u00e9mon Black and White 2. The Direct also teased that both old and new legendary Pok\u00e9mon would be available in the expansions, as would several pre-existing Pok\u00e9mon that were not present in the base game, such as Garchomp, Blastoise, Venusaur and many others. The Direct stated that there will be roughly 200 old Pok\u00e9mon in total entering the game through the Expansion Pass.[14] Certain Pok\u00e9mon and characters will be exclusive to Sword or Shield. Players who do not purchase the Expansion Pass can still acquire the Pok\u00e9mon through trading. \"The Isle of Armor\" expansion is set to release in June of 2020 and \"The Crown Tundra\" will release in Fall of 2020. They are available for pre-purchase for $29.99.                    Reception The game received intense backlash prior to its release due to what fans perceived as poor quality in leaked footage and data about the game. These issues largely stemmed from the cutting of 400 Pok\u00e9mon from the National Pok\u00e9dex (making Sword and Shield the first games in the series to not include every Pok\u00e9mon in the series' history). Game Freak had stated that they had made this choice in order to create higher quality animations for the existing Pok\u00e9mon in the game. When footage of the game leaked, however, fans did not accept Game Freak's excuse, claiming that the animations were not significantly improved enough from previous titles to justify the cut Pok\u00e9mon. Several moves that had appeared in previous games were also cut from the games, including moves popular in the competitive Pok\u00e9mon scene like Return and Frustration. These frustrations were covered in hashtags #BringBackNationalDex and #GameFreakLied. Critical Reception Though fans had generated significant backlash to the games prior to their release, critics were mostly positive about Sword and Shield. On the day of the game's release, the game's Metacritic score was 81, or \"generally favorable.\"[11] Some critics called them \"the best Pok\u00e9mon games in years.\" Gamespot[12] wrote the game \"cut down on the tedious and protracted elements from previous games in favor of amplifying what makes Pokemon great in the first place.\" In the least positive review included in Metacritic's score, the Daily Star gave the game a 3/5,[13] writing that Dynamaxing was \"a shallow imitation of past games\u2019 features,\" and that the \"Wild Area,\" the games' new wild-Pok\u00e9mon feature, was akin to \"a level-gated Safari Zone.\" Critic Dom Peppiatt concluded that the game could be thought of as a \"good-not-great\" Pok\u00e9mon game.                    Online Presence #BringBackNationalDex Bring Back National Dex refers to the backlash towards the reveal that Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield will not allow players to transfer Pok\u00e9mon absent from the Galar Regional Pok\u00e9dex, breaking the series's tradition of having all Pok\u00e9mon from past generations usable in one title, even if they are not able to be caught in-game. Following this restriction's reveal at Nintendo Treehouse's E3 2019 presentation, fans voiced their displeasure towards it over various social media outlets, and the aforementioned presentation became the most disliked video of E3 2019[10].    #ThankYouGameFreak #ThankYouGameFreak is a hashtag started by a Pok\u00e9mon fan intended to celebrate and appreciate Pok\u00e9mon developers Game Freak amid ongoing criticisms and controversy for the as-yet unreleased Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield. Many fans used the hashtag as intended, while others used it more sarcastically to further criticize Game Freak. A rival hashtag, \"#FuckYouGameFreak\" was started alongside it to voice criticisms of the series. On November 9th, 2019, Twitter user @MysticUmbreon94 posted, \"I wanted to see if I could start a #ThankYouGameFreak trend. #ThankYouGamefreak for creating the games that got me through all the tough times in my childhood. I know times are rough, but there are still fans that love what you do. Spread if you appreciate what Gamefreak does.\" The tweet gained over 3,200 retweets and 11,000 likes (shown below).    The hashtag inspired others to share their positive experiences with the Pok\u00e9mon series. Twitter user @heyshanmurphy tweeted several pieces of fan art with the hashtag, gaining over 260 retweets and 1,400 likes (shown below, left). User @TamashiiHiroka tweeted, \"#ThankYouGameFreak Your games helped me survive the hardest years of my life and taught me how to problem solve, strategize, explore, appreciate nature, and connected me to thousands of people when I felt the most alone. I wouldn't be who I am today without Pokemon for sure,\" gaining over 170 retweets and 1,500 likes (shown below, right). In response to the praise, Pok\u00e9mon director Junichi Masuda tweeted, \"Thank you, everyone!\"     However, many Twitter users used the hashtag to lob further criticisms at Game Freak. User @fina_sergio tweeted criticism of the game's \"generic backgrounds,\" echoing criticisms that the series' animation has not significantly improved (shown below, left). Additionally, angry fans started a counter-hashtag, \"#FuckYouGameFreak\" to voice further criticisms of the game's early footage and cut content. User @DudeMcShoot tweeted, \"#FuckYouGameFreak your fanbase is full of spineless cowards who would rather lick your boot than have any form of self respect.\"     #GameFreakLied #GameFreakLied is a hashtag used to complain about Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield after an apparent data-mine of the as-yet-unreleased games appeared to confirm that Pok\u00e9mon developers Game Freak had reused character models and animations from previous entries in the series. The company had previously taken the position that it was forced to \"cut a significant amount of Pok\u00e9mon because it was remaking animations and character models from scratch. The decision, colloquially known as \"Dexit\", was unpopular with fans and upon seeing that Game Freak's excuse did not seem legitimate, fans tweeted angrily about the upcoming games using leaked footage. On November 12th, 2019, Redditor MindWeb125 posted a thread in /r/pokemon showing allegedly leaked data-mined comparisons of several Sword and Shield Pok\u00e9mon models and the same Pok\u00e9mon models from the previous games, Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon. This was significant as Game Freak's Junichi Masuda and Shigeru Ohmori had previously stated that the reason many Pok\u00e9mon from previous entries were cut in Sword and Shield was so the team could focus on remaking Pok\u00e9mon from scratch.     Meanwhile, the leaks were posted to Twitter by user @BlazingFlare, two posted GIFs comparing models, gaining over 160 retweets and 440 likes (shown below).   I've been going through the returning Pokemon models in SwSh and comparing them to the ones from SuMo, and so far every model I've checked has (unsurprisingly) been 100% identical. pic.twitter.com/ehyytH0QQY\u2014 Blazingflare (@Blazingflare) November 13, 2019    Shortly after MindWeb125's post, Redditor BigHailFan posted about the leaks with the hashtag #GameFreakLied, suggesting anger about the leaks be shared with the hashtag, gaining over 25,000 points. Users then took to Twitter to post their frustration with the leaked information about the new games. User @Eldgammel tweeted a comparison between Sun and Moon's Hau and Sword and Shield's Hop, gaining over 500 retweets and 3,000 likes (shown below, top). User @GonFreecs1 tweeted some leaked footage from the game showing basic animations, gaining over 380 retweets and 1,800 likes (shown below, bottom).   #GameFreakLied These are the \"new animations\", Hop uses the same animations as Hau from Sun and Moon pic.twitter.com/1VMPMJ7Zbf \u2014 Thorsen (@Eldgammel) November 13, 2019      BRUH I can't believe this is happening lol, I'm still gonna buy it tho \ud83d\udc40 #GameFreakLied pic.twitter.com/QfX3ttAY5m\u2014 Gon / Josue (@GonFreecs01) November 13, 2019                       Search Interest                        External References  [1] Twitter Moments \u2013 Celebrating 23 years of Pok\u00e9mon on Pok\u00e9mon Day [2] Endgadget \u2013 'Pok\u00e9mon Sword' and 'Shield' come to Nintendo Switch on November 15th [3] Twitter \u2013 @pankendev [4] Twitter \u2013 @bkub_comic [5] Twitter Moments \u2013 The fan art is flowing with the introduction of Pok\u00e9mon's Sonia [6] Twitter \u2013 Little_Luly [7] Twitter \u2013 hommie_ya [8] Polygon \u2013 Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield has a corgi Pok\u00e9mon [9] Twitter \u2013 @SerebiiNet [10] Reddit \u2013 Currently Pok\u00e9mon is the most hated game in this year E3 [11] Metacritic \u2013 Pokemon Sword and Shield [12] Gamespot \u2013 Pokemon Sword and Shield review [13] Daily Star \u2013 Pokemon Sword and Shield review Nintendo Switch debut arrives not with a bang, but with a Yamper [14] VentureBeat \u2013 Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield get Expansion Pass content                     Latest Editorial And News       How Standing On The Gravitron Became The Ultimate Meme Of Rebellion        TikToker Justine Paradise Accuses Jake Paul Of Sexual Assault        Legendary Rapper DMX Dies At 50        Maggie Goldenberger Auctioning Off Original \u2018Ermahgerd\u2019 Photo As Meme NFTs Continue Trending Online"}, "Congratulations!

Among them included a BuzzFeed post titled \"This Guy With Four Daughters Just Might Be The Funniest Dad on Twitter.\"    Books In October 2017, the comedian published his debut book Only Dead on the Inside: A Parent\u2019s Guide for Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse.[2] On November 6th, 2018, Breakwell released the book Bare Minimum Parenting: The Ultimate Guide to Not Quite Ruining Your Child.[2]     Interview With Know Your Meme Q: What made you first decide to tweet the conversations / daily life experiences you have with your children?  A: I write about what\u2019s around me. Currently, my house is overrun by children. It seemed like an obvious choice.  Q: How did you initially react to internet fame?  A: I\u2019d been trying to make it as a comedy writer for ten years before I went viral. I felt vindicated when it finally happened. It turns out you really can fail your way to the top. Q: What gave you the idea to write your two books Only Dead on the Inside: A Parent\u2019s Guide to Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse and Bare Minimum Parenting: The Ultimate Guide to Not Quite Ruining Your Child. A: For Only Dead on the Inside, I wanted to write the most non-traditional parenting guide possible, so I took regular parenting advice and set it in the zombie apocalypse. It turns out raising a kid is kind of a disaster, regardless of whether or not the world has ended, so parents might not notice much of a change.  For Bare Minimum Parenting, I wanted to contradict all the parenting books out there that convince people to become overbearing helicopter parents. If most kids grow up to be mediocre adults anyway, why not get them there in the easiest way possible? It started out as a joke, but I accidentally proved a point: Being a laid back, carefree parent is actually better for your kid than being a stressed-out, overachieving one. Q: You\u2019ve been accused of making tweets up. How did you respond to these claims?  A: My tweets are a mix. Some are real, some are exaggerated, and some are made up, but they\u2019re all inspired by my kids. These are the kinds of things my daughters say and do, even if they didn\u2019t literally say or do them that day. That\u2019s why my jokes ring true to so many parents. The people who have a problem with my comedy tend to be childless. Q: Is it possible to make a living just tweeting? If so how can somebody make it happen? A: I don\u2019t know of anyone who is making a living just off Twitter, but I suppose anything is possible. I support myself with a mix of book deals, paid social media ads, and freelance writing gigs. That\u2019s pretty common these days. It\u2019s hard to make a living as just an author or just a social media influencer. You need multiple revenue streams.

She sarcastically insults what the Yes campaign are 'claiming' such as keeping the Pound sterling in a currency union with the Bank of England which she claims 'It'll all be fine, I've heard that before' and then after making up her mind, she declares that she is choosing to vote No.                    Spread 2014 Scottish independence referendum The advert gained a considerable amount of criticism as it was branded 'sexist' and 'patronising' and the day after the advert aired, pro-independence supporters mocked the advert by creating and editing pictures with intentional ridiculous captions to convey the advert's claims of 'fearmongering' and the hashtag #PatronisingBTLady trended on Twitter the day after the advert had aired. Due to the spread, several news sites picked up on the mockery of the advert, including the Guardian, BuzzFeed and HeraldScotland. 2016 European Union membership referendum Because of Scotland's European Union membership was under threat if Scotland had voted Yes in the 2014 referendum, that was the main reason why many voters had voted No. Two years later in 2016, Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Union whilst the majority of England and Wales voted to leave the European Union as part of the 2016 EU membership referendum.     Due to this, the Woman Who Made Up Her Mind meme resurfaced with many pro-Scottish independence supporters remaking the advert with the woman reacting to the promises that were made in the 2014 independence referendum which turned out to be 'false lies' and remarking that this wasn't what she voted for in 2014.                    Criticism The advert had gained a considerable amount of criticism as many described the woman in the advert as a 'stereotypical house wife' and for 'patronising' viewers watching at home. It was also criticised for it's fearmongering by creating ridiculous fabricated information to viewers. This was the main reason why it had in a sense backfired and turned into mockery.

Many critics praised the game's balance between simplicity for new players and challenge in the post-game content for series veterans, while also lauding the game's play into nostalgia with a much more colorful and hi-definition version of the Kanto region. Other critics were disappointed by the game's low difficulty. Some were down on the new method of catching Pok\u00e9mon. As opposed to the traditional method of battling a Pok\u00e9mon until it's weak, in Let's Go players, use the Switch's joy-cons to mimic \"tossing\" a Pok\u00e9ball, which was sometimes a frustrating mechanic.[2]                    Online Presence Pikachu and Eevee Haircuts Pikachu and Eevee Haircuts refer to jokes made about a feature in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go! games which allows players to give the mascots of the respective games, Pikachu and Eevee, different hair styles. Social media users joked about the designs, particularly the bangs style on each Pok\u00e9mon. On July 12th, 2018, Nintendo released a trailer for the Pok\u00e9mon Let's Go! games. The trailer showed some features of the upcoming games, including the inclusion of familiar characters from the anime series. The trailer also demonstrated how characters could select haircut styles for their chosen starter Pok\u00e9mon (shown below).  After the trailer's release, social media users immediately joked about the haircut feature. Twitter user @SNatent joked that Officer Jenny would take the Pok\u00e9mon away from you if you gave them bangs, gaining over 970 retweets and 3,100 likes (shown below, left). User @ConnieKuroi joked about Eevee with bangs, gaining over 130 retweets and 800 likes (shown below, right).     Meltan Meltan is a Steel-type Mythical Pok\u00e9mon. The character has the body of a \"Ditto\" Pok\u00e9mon with the a hexagonal head that resembles a hex nut. The character garnered attention due to its mysterious roll-out in Pokemon GO, and was later announced to be included in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go. On September 21st, Twitter user @Chrales tweeted a series of code from the augmented reality game Pok\u00e9mon GO, which originally named the character \"Kecleon\" (shown below, left). Later that day, they tweeted, \"new kecleon icons,\" which showed images of the character that would become \"Meltan.\" The tweet received more than 500 retweets and 1,700 likes in four days.     On October 24, 2018, a new video was posted to the official Pokemon Youtube channel (shown below, left), showcasing the evolved form of Meltan after several of the creatures merged, named Melmetal. The first Mythical Pokemon known to evolve and also a Steel-type, it was originally foreshadowed in a previous trailer for Pokemon Let's Go, where its shadow could be seen near the end. However, it was here that it was officially shown. Further details were revealed such as its unique Steel-type move \"Double Iron Bash\" and how it could be obtained.     After its reveal, many noted the creature's larger and bulkier form, compared to Meltan's smaller and more malleable form, sometimes using the term \"absolute unit\" to describe it.

After it appeared on Twitter, it quickly spread on Facebook and Reddit leading more people to make their own versions.

After the 2016 EU referendum, which resulted in Scotland voting to heavily to remain in the European Union, the meme resurfaced, some had made new pictures which showed Nicola Sturgeon reacting to the result of the referendum.

Downing Street rejected proposals for other parties to get involved in the proposed debate \u2013 mainly the SNP.

In one screenshot, a Facebook user told the story of how they were under the impression that the band sold 180 tickets to a show at a venue called The Exchange, though no sales were made at the venue and the only people who showed were on the support band's guest list. The user then said that the band's 38,000 likes on Facebook had been paid for and all attendees for the event were based in Brazil. Another screenshot showed venue The Underground Camden replying to a Threatin post saying Threatin promised 291 people had bought tickets for a show there but three people showed up.     BBC Newsbeat talked to The Underground Camden,[3] who reported that Threatin played with intensity despite the empty venue. Furthermore, there were allegations that live videos of the band prior to the tour had been doctored to make it appear as though the band were playing to large crowds. A \"live performance\" of the band posted June 13th, 2016 was accused of combining crowd footage from a different show with Threatin's music (shown below, left). A promotional video for the UK tour posted by Threatin spliced footage of the singer playing while large crowd shots were interspersed, implying that the crowds were for him (shown below, right).     After the story was picked up by outlets such as BBC[3] and NME,[4] Dane Davis, the hired drummer for the tour, interviewed with Louder Sound[5] explaining how he had been duped and was paid $300 total for the tour. He learned the tour and band were a fake when news outlets published articles about it, and the tour was abandoned after that.

This set off a nationwide bidding war as most states submitted proposals for Amazon to choose their city. Over a year after Amazon announced the initiative, the company announced it had chosen to place headquarters in New York City and northern Virginia, and faced intense backlash from citizens of those areas who feared Amazon's presence would increase housing costs and that the cost of hosting Amazon would be a misuse of tax revenue that could go to more worthwhile causes. Amazon eventually cancelled the New York City deal after resistance from local politicians.", "origin": "", "other_text": "Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce Vinny Sexual Misconduct Allegations        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       Background On September 20th, 2017, Amazon announced that they would be looking to build a second headquarters to supplement their Seattle headquarters.[1] In asking for proposals from cities, Amazon said its requirements were thus:  Metropolitan areas with a population of over 1 million Within 30 miles (48 km) of a population center Within 45 minutes of an international airport Proximity to major highways and arterial roads 1\u20133 miles (2\u20135 km) Access to mass transit routes Up to 8 million square feet (740,000 m2) of office space for future expansion                     Developments The announcement set off a bidding war between 238 cities in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Influential figures in some of these cities set up campaigns in an attempt to woo Amazon. For example, Kansas City, Missouri mayor Sly James purchased 5,000 Amazon products which he donated to charity, and gave five-star reviews to each product while touting Kansas City's attributes. New York City mayor Bill De Blasio lit up New York's landmarks in orange to show the city wanted Amazon. On January 20th, 2018, Amazon announced 20 finalist cities. During the process, some criticized the bidding war set up by the company. Little Rock, Arkansas took out a full page ad in the Washington Post announcing their decision to withdraw their bid.[2] Professor Scott Galloway called the bidding war a sham, predicting in early 2018 that the only contenders were the Washington D.C. area and New York City, as both areas were close to Bezos' homes.[3] When he was proven right later that year, Galloway accused the bidding war of being a con to make New York and the Washington D.C. area sweeten their bids with more tax breaks for the company.[4] Writing in the Atlantic,[5] Derek Thompson claimed the bidding war was shameful and should be illegal. Final Choice On November 13th, 2018, Amazon confirmed that they would be splitting their second headquarters between New York City and Crystal City, Virginia, a town near Washington D.C.[6] The New York City headquarters would be in the Long Island City neighborhood of the Queens borough. In a blog post, Amazon stated they will get over $1.5 billion in direct incentives for placing their headquarters in New York, promising over 25,000 jobs in the city.[7] They would also create 25,000 jobs in Crystal City, Virginia, receiving a $573 million incentive. They also announced they would create an \"Operations Center of Excellence\" in Nashville, Tennessee, creating 5,000 jobs. Citizens of both areas were displeased with the announcement. Local New York City politicians, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated that the response from the populace had been outrage while others promised protest. Evidently, New York governor Andrew Cuomo and Bill De Blasio made the decision without public input.[8] Twitter users in New York City announced their displeasure with the decision while arguing that the $1.5 billion the city was giving Amazon could be better used for projects like improving the city's mass transit system or improving education. Additionally, many took issue with the fact that part of the Amazon agreement involved constructing a taxpayer-funded helipad ostensibly for Bezos.     Northern Virginians also were worried about Amazon's influence on their area, as many voiced fears for rising housing costs.     New York Cancellation On February 14th, 2019, Amazon announced that they cancelled their plans to create a headquarters in New York City.[9] The move came after a February 13th meeting between Amazon and local union leaders opposed to the company's move to New York City which reportedly found Amazon unwilling to compromise. New York State Senator Michael Gianaris, whose neighborhood included Long Island City, stated, \"Like a petulant child, Amazon insists on getting its way or takes its ball and leaves. The only thing that happened here is that a community that was going to be profoundly affected by their presence started asking questions.\u2019\u2019 Amazon blamed the cancellation on resistance from local politicians, though they saw data which suggested the move was popular among New York City Residents. They also stated that they had no plans to open another location other than their already planned location in the Northern Virginia area. The cancellation was mostly praised online by New York City residents. Twitter user jayasax congratulated New York's organized resistance to the move, gaining over 280 retweets and 1,100 likes (shown below, left). User DanRiffle wrote, \"amazon is still perfectly welcome to build in NYC--always has been. They just have to give up the bullying. You can't have a 'positive, collaborative relationship' with a community if your terms are 'pay our $3B bribe or we're out.'\" The tweet indicated that the cancellation was indicative of Amazon's refusal to back away from the $3 billion tax break promised by New York, and had they been willing to compromise on that, the deal may have gone through.     Others were less thrilled about the cancellation. NBC reporter Tom Winters bemoaned the loss of the 25,000 jobs Amazon had promised when New York City was facing $2.3 billion shortfall in tax revenue (shown below, left). However, many Twitter users argued with him saying that giving Amazon $3 billion would only worsen the problem.[10] Political commentator John Burnett stated the cancellation was a lesson in how progressives kill jobs (shown below, right).     Other Twitter users tweeted jokes about the news. Writer Jason Gilbert wrote a joke that gained over 690 retweets and 4,000 likes (shown below, left). Many Twitter users joked that the decision was reminiscent of a common type of Medium essay about people leaving New York.[11][12] One popular example was tweeted by Twitter user @DaveWeigel (shown below, right).

Much like the \u201cone girl swaying alone\u201d twist in Lorde\u2019s \u201cLiability,\u201d it\u2019s an eloquent display of inner strength and incisive self-awareness; \"thank u, next\" embraces a rare mindset that perhaps not so many people, let alone famous pop stars, grant to their exes. The high road might not be the easiest path, but Grande offers to lead us there by her own example.\u201d  \"Aubrey\" Misheard Lyric In \"thank u, next,\" when detailing a new relationship, Grande sings, \"But this one gon' last / 'Cause her name is Ari,\" implying that she is focusing on herself.  However, many misheard the lyric as stating \"Her name is Aubrey,\" which would imply Grande had entered a same-sex relationship. When Apple Music uploaded the track to its streaming service, they provided the misheard lyric. This prompted Grande to correct the service on Twitter (shown below).    Twitter users joked about the misheard lyric as though Grande had entered a homosexual relationship. User @sbstryker posted an image of the Jenners mocking their own inability to understand the lyric, gaining 420 retweets and 4,111 likes (shown below, left). User @visionsofgrande posted an image of Shrek joking about the lyric, gaining over 280 retweets and 3,600 likes (shown below, right). The jokes were covered by Preen and Elite Daily.     One Taught Me\u2026 In the pre-chorus of the song, Grande sings, \u201cOne taught me love, one taught me patience, and one taught me pain.\u201d Twitter users joked about this lyric by tweeting it along with three pictures representing the ones who taught them love, patience, and pain. These were usually characters from pop culture. For example, @ryanbloomquist tweeted the three male leads from Mamma Mia 2, gaining over 7,000 retweets and 26,000 likes (shown below, left). User @ayoedibiri made the joke with the Shrek films, gaining over 7,500 retweets and 31,000 likes (shown below, right).

On July 22nd, 2009, the affiliated channel to the series totheark was created and subsequently uploaded its first video to Youtube, titled \"Regards\" (shown below, left) in response to the ninth episode in the series (shown below, right). The video, featuring the coded message \"LOOK CLOSELY\" would garner over 699,000 views in the following years.     The series would run for 3 seasons across 133 different videos, including 87 official entry uploads and 39 accompanying totheark responses. The End On June 20th, 2014, slightly over five years since the series started, the final episode of the series \"Entry #87\" was uploaded to Youtube.  Clear Lakes 44 / ECKVA Clear Lakes 44 was a spin-off of Marble Hornets that started on August 3rd, 2015 before its abrupt cancellation due to the creative team splitting up and Troy's disillusionment with the direction of the series.[13] It only consisted of 13 short broadcasts uploaded to the Marble Hornets channel that lasted only a few minutes. The series is now currently unlisted, though a playlist containing all videos in the series can be found here.     On September 25th, 2016, those who entered their email onto what was a site for the Clear Lakes 44 ARG received an email that the in-universe company Clear Lakes Communications would be bought by an unknown owner.[14] 4 days prior, the Marble Hornets Twitter, then going under the Clear Lakes 44 name, tweeted out the phrase \"i see with new eyes\".[15] On October 13th, a new spin-off called ECKVA was started with the uploading of a video titled \"ECKVA1\" on its channel \"eckvanet\". To date, the channel has uploaded 18 public videos. On February 7th, 2020, Troy announced a prequel book to ECKVA titled ARKListener would be arriving in March, though this is thought to be delayed.[3]     Film In 2015, a film spinoff of the series titled Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story was released, first to video on demand services on April 7th followed by a limited release to theaters on May 15th. Directed by James Moran, it received negative reviews upon release, receiving a 4.7/10 rating from over 2,000 users on IMDb.[4] Horror Youtubers were also negative towards the film (examples shown below).     Comic On December 27th, 2017, Troy teased towards a Marble Hornets-related project posting a picture of a mask belonging to an unknown figure from Entry #26, teasing towards a reveal for next year (shown below left). On January 12th, 2018, Troy announced on his blog the development of a 5 issue comic book series written by him and with art done by Jackie Reynolds.[5] Acting as a continuation of the webseries, the first issue, subtitled \"Regards\" was originally meant for release in December of that year[6], though was delayed to February 25th, 2019 as a digital format[7][8], with a print issue following a few months later on April 8th[9] (cover shown below, right).     On May 12th, 2019, a Kickstarter to fund the creation of the remaining books in the series, with stretch goals including a complete one book copy of the five issue series, an exclusive art print, and a standalone totheark comic. The campaign raised over $28,000, exceeding its initial goal of $10,000 dollars[10], and its second issue, subtitled \"Eyes Open\" was released on February 29th, 2020.[11]                      Impact Marble Hornets had a large impact in popularizing the Slender Man mythos and character, with it most likely being the first Slender Man webseries on the internet as the series was started nine days after SomethingAwful user Victor Surge posted the original two images of the character.[18] The popularity of the series would eventually lead to other Slender Man web series being created by other people, such as Adam Rosner's TribeTwelve (shown below, left), and EverymanHYBRID, which integrated the character The Rake into its continuity (shown below, right).     Marble Hornets also helped in pioneering and establishing common tropes seen within the Slender Man mythos such as the Operator symbol, depicted as a crossed-out circle (shown below, left), human proxies, and audio/video distortion when seen on camera (shown below, right). The latter was implemented heavily in the free 2012 indie horror game Slender: The Eight Pages, developed by Mark Hadley under the name Parsec Productions. Marble Hornets' production team would later be involved in writing the script for the game's sequel Slender: The Arrival in 2013, developed by Parsec Productions in collaboration with Blue Isle Studios.[19]                        Online Relevance On Youtube, Marble Hornets has a sizable presence, with over 544,000 subscribers on the main channel[1], and over 99,000 subscribers on the affiliated totheark channel.[2] The spinoff ECKVA has garnered a small, if not notable presence with over 23,000 subscribers on its Youtube page.[12] The official Twitter page for the series was started in June 2009 and would later go on to accrue over 50,000 followers in the following decade.[16] The affiliated account for ECKVA, @SHawkins1926, has garnered over 6,000 followers since October 2016.[17]                    Reception and Legacy Since its release, Marble Hornets been the subject of praise and has remained a staple on the internet. Marble Hornets has been praised by film critic Roger Ebert, who linked the series on his Twitter account[25]. The series has a TVTropes page[20], a subreddit[23], and 2 fan wikis.[21][22] The series continues to have a following online, as mentioned in a 2019 Verge interview with one of the creators, Tim Sutton, who writes \"The series transcends generations; many Gen Z kids are friending and following the Marble Hornets creators today. \"The fan base has been getting gradually younger,\" Sutton said. \"I get a lot of messages from kids that are like 14 and under. I got a comment on one of my Instagram posts the other day that said they were 11, and I was like, 'Are you kidding me?'\"[24]. Popular YouTuber Night Mind, who specializes in unfiction and ARGs, has released a multipart explainer series on Marble Hornets, the first part having over a million views (shown below). The series to date holds an 8.2 on IMDb.[26]  Fan Art                            Search Interest                        External References  [1] YouTube \u2013 Marble Hornets channel [2] YouTube \u2013 totheark channel [3] Twitter \u2013 Troy Wagner [4] IMDb \u2013 Always Watching [5] Troy Wagner Blog \u2013 The Return [6] Twitter \u2013 Troy Wagner [7] Twitter \u2013 Troy Wagner [8] Twitter \u2013 Troy Wagner [9] Twitter \u2013 Grampo Co.

The complete story, made from the posts, can be seen on YouTube[2] The series was very popular on Instagram, spawning many original dubs like it, and dubs that remixed its audio both on Instagram and other social media sites. On November 11th, 2018, PewDiePie included the video in his weekly Meme Review.  Besides catapulting it to far greater popularity, the most important thing that these videos did to help the meme as a whole was the \"n word pass\". Throughout the series, it is established that entities which aren't black humans can not say the n word without causing an explosion around themselves. At the end, Barack Obama gave Skipper \"the n word pass\" to allow him to say the n word without causing an explosion. Once people began making their own videos, inspired by the series, memes started appearing in which people would refer to the n word pass, sometimes called the n pass, and a pardon from Barack Obama as things that would prevent said explosions.                Songs On November 5th, 2018, the song \"I\u2019m Gonna Say the n Word \"was released by the user DA3GENTLEMAN on the website Anghami.

The story starts off in an alternate version of the world of its predecessor.[1] On October 31st, 2018, the first chapter of the game was released for free on PC and Mac. On February 28th, 2019, a console edition of the first chapter was also released for free on Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4.

Undertale Twitter Account Takeover Later that day, the Undertale Twitter account's name was changed to \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\" and featured both a blank icon and blank banner. The account then posted a series of tweets from an unnamed individual that said the viewer needed to return in 24 hours so that they can ask the viewer a few questions (shown below, left). On October 31st, the Undertale Twitter account announced Deltarune's first chapter and linked a website that hosted a free download to the game's first chapter (shown below, right). The Deltarune website initially mentioned to not discuss the game for 24 hours.[2]     The account username was later changed to \"UNDERTALE / DELTARUNE,\" and the icon was changed to the logo of Deltarune.                    Premise The game takes place on the surface in an alternate version of the world of Undertale. The main character Kris is awoken by his mother Toriel so that he won't be late for school. After Kris arrives late to school, he needs to find himself a partner for a group project. Kris ends up with Susie, a notoriously violent student who's demeanor is akin to that of a bully. After they're sent to find more chalk in the supply closet, they both find that the entrance to this \"supply closet\" opens to an abnormally dark room. Soon after they both hesitantly enter, the ground beneath them vanishes and they fall into a black abyss. They both find themselves in a strange new world, mysteriously wearing new attire and gear. They are met by Ralsei, who appears to be a kind and somewhat childlike character. Ralsei explains that the three of them are the \"Delta Warriors,\" prophesied heroes that are destined to save the world.                    Gameplay The gameplay deviates a bit from that of Undertale's, with the main difference being the implementation of a new partner system. The player is given the ability to use multiple characters for each turn, with the exception of Susie for most of Chapter 1.    Online Presence Ralsei Ralsei is one of the three Delta Warriors, referred to as the \"Prince of the Dark.\"[3] He wears a green wizard's hat, a pink scarf and glasses. The character quickly became the inspiration of many memes and fan art. In the former category, KnowYourMeme user NottaWatta posted a Pledge to Protect meme with the character, gaining 48 likes (shown below, left). Tumblr user velvetart posted a Ligma joke about the character, gaining over 870 notes (shown below, right).     Examples of fan art for the character include a post by Twitter user @catteboots which managed to get 800 retweets and 2.900 likes (shown below, left), Tumblr user kilinah that gained over 1,400 notes (shown below, center). Twitter user @gunmouth posted art that gained 81 retweets and 326 likes (shown below, right).      Ralsei's Gun One of the more popular subgenres of Ralsei fan art depicts the character wielding a gun underneath its coat, in contrast with his sweet demeanor. On November 3rd, Tumblr[6] user bran-draws-things posted a drawing of Ralsei holding a gun underneath his coat (shown below).    This led to further depictions of Ralsei wielding a gun. Some popular examples include a piece of fan art by DeviantArt artist Neloku in which Ralsei had several chain guns (shown below, left) and a Reddit post by user Vyralys that gained over 500 points (shown below, right).     Jevil Jevil is a secret boss in chapter 1 of Deltarune.[4] He appears as a jester character. The character's mischievous nature led to parodies of the character, particularly his line, \"I can do anything.\" For example, a user on /v/ posted a joke about the character (shown below, left). Imgur user Deaconsbluesclues posted a Pull My Devil Trigger GIF of the character, which gained 50 points on /r/TwoBestFriendsPlay (shown below, right).     Krusie Krusie is the online name given to a ship between the characters Kris, the main protagonist of Deltarune, and Susie, an NPC who joins the player's party. Susie is generally depicted as being flustered in the ship, attempting to keep her composure to Kris' advances. DeviantArt user JustAGirlOnline drew such an example of the ship (shown below, left). Many examples of Krusie fan art can be found on Tumblr.[5]                         Search Interest                        External References  [1] TwitLonger \u2013 Toby Fox's Deltarune FAQ [2] archive.is \u2013 Deltarune website [archived] [3] Wiki \u2013 Ralsei [4] Wiki \u2013 Deltarune [5] Tumblr \u2013 Krusie [6] Tumblr \u2013 bran-draws-things      Latest Editorial And News       How Standing On The Gravitron Became The Ultimate Meme Of Rebellion        TikToker Justine Paradise Accuses Jake Paul Of Sexual Assault        Legendary Rapper DMX Dies At 50        Maggie Goldenberger Auctioning Off Original \u2018Ermahgerd\u2019 Photo As Meme NFTs Continue Trending Online"}, "Anime Girls Holding Signs": {"image": "https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/545/fuck_off.png", "type": ["Photoshop"], "origin_year": "Exploitable,", "date_added": "2018-11-03T12:44:40-04:00", "views": 15175, "videos": 0, "photos": 72, "comments": 8, "about": "", "origin": "The exact origin of the meme is unclear.

Stripe Payments Terminated On June 10th, 2018, Stripe, the online payment processing service, terminated its relationship with BitChute, citing \"a restriction imposed upon us directly from our financial partners, who use have an archaic and frankly antiquated view of non-traditional businesses.\"[2]                    Features Much like YouTube, BitChute has a search bar, allowing users to search for specific topics or videos. Additionally, the videos can be found through categories (shown below, left). Payments and donations can be also be made on the site through Patreon and PayPal. The site allows you to sign up for three different pricing tiers: Bronze, Silver and Gold (shown below, right).                        Highlights Criticisms BitChute has been criticized for allowing users that have since been banned from YouTube, Facebook and other social networks for promoting baseless conspiracy theories, fake news and inflammatory material that could incite violent behavior. For example, InfoWars remains one of BitChute's most popular channels despite being de-platformed on various other social networks. Popular channels and topics on the site include Holocaust denial, white supremacy and conspiracy theories, which operate alongside seemingly benign topics, such as make-up tutorials and do-it-yourself projects. In 2018, The Daily Dot [3] wrote of BitChute: But if we look back at the Pittsburgh shooting, or the Florida mail bomber, or even the 2017 white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, that ended in a woman\u2019s death, it\u2019s clear freedom of expression often means freedom to espouse racist, hateful views. On sites like BitChute, Twitter, YouTube, and Gab, that often happens without consequence. BitChute wants to be a rogue ship in the video ecosystem that rails against censorship, but when violent, extremist, white supremacist content is still flourishing and reaching an audience on YouTube, is it really an alternative? And as its user base grows, will BitChute just end up facing the same issues YouTube is still figuring out?

During the war, Soros was taken in by a Hungarian bureaucrat named Baumbach, who helped hide young Soros, then in his early teens, from the Nazis. At this time, one of Baumbach's jobs was to take inventory of seized Jewish possessions. Snopes[2] reports that in his 1965 autobiography, Soros's father Tivadar Soros that in efforts to make him happy, Baumbach took young Soros on trips to confiscated Jewish estates. They write: \"He even helped with the inventory,\" Tivadar Soros wrote. It\u2019s a detail one doesn\u2019t find in Kaufman\u2019s book. Some may rush to cite this as proof that Soros was a \u201ccollaborator\u201d after all, but given that it occurred on only one occasion, and that Soros was under an imperative to convincingly play the part of Baumbach\u2019s godson while in the company of the actual Nazi collaborators, it doesn\u2019t fly. In 1998, Soros gave an interview with the news magazine series 60 Minutes (interview below). During the interview, he explained his role in Baumbach's work as \"only a spectator, the property was being taken away. So the -- I had no role in taking away that property.\" However, despite his denials in the interview, the clip has been used to incorrectly provide evidence of the conspiracy theory.                     Spread Throughout the 2000s, the Soros conspiracy theory has been used as a talking point for inflammatory right-wing pundits. For examples on February 8th, 2007, KSFO radio hosts Lee Rodgers and Officer Vic said Soros \"very cheerfully and willingly, went to work for the Nazis.\" They said:[1] LEE RODGERS: Now, here is the inconsistency problem that Mr. Soros, like so many Democrats, displays. Given his personal history, a cynical person might think George Soros would be delighted to see the Nazis in charge, because in 1944, when the Germans invaded his native country, Hungary, and took over, Mr. Soros hid the fact that he's a Jew -- you can't really blame him for that --  OFFICER VIC: No.  RODGERS: -- it's about survival; a lot of people did it. But then, he, apparently very cheerfully and willingly, went to work for the Nazis, as other Jews were being killed or shipped off to the death camps, he ran around Hungary with Nazi officials, serving eviction notices to people who were going to be shipped out on the death trains --  OFFICER VIC: Oh, my God.  RODGERS: \u2013 so his Nazi buddies could come in and confiscate their property. Now, if you doubt this \u2013 any of you whiny liberals \u2013 \"Well, I heard that on a conservative program. They had to have made it up\" \u2013 just do a little Internet search of your own, go to Yahoo or Google or whatever you want, and write in \"George Soros,\" plus the word \"Nazis,\" plus \"1944.\" Take a look. See what comes up. See for yourself. Among the most well-known early references to the conspiracy theory is a retraction from a story in the Toronto Sun by Ezra Levant on September 5th, 2010. The article states, \"Theodore hatched a better plan for his son. He bribed a non-Jewish official at the agriculture ministry to let George live with him. George helped the official confiscate property from Jews. By collaborating with the Nazis, George survived the Holocaust. He turned on other Jews to spare himself.\"[1] The article prompted threats of a lawsuit from Soros and a retraction by the star.[3][4] Soros spokesman Michael Vacon said of the article: It made false, defamatory and offensive statements and as a result Mr. Soros has notified the relevant parties of his intent to sue. What is of concern in the article are the false assertions that Mr. Levant makes regarding George Soros's conduct as a 13-year-old child in Nazi-occupied Hungary. Months later, conservative pundit Glenn Beck espoused the conspiracy theory on his Fox News television program on November 11th, 2010.[5] It was not the first time. Years earlier, on March 2nd, 2009, right-wing commentator Ann Coulter appeared on Beck's show and called Soros \"a Nazi collaborator, literally.\"[1] Oskar Groening Photo One of the most popular memes that depict Soros as a Nazi collaborators uses a photograph of Oskar Groening, a Nazi officer who served at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II, in a Waffen-SS uniform. One of the earliest known uses of the image was posted by Twitter [6] user @toombstone (shown below, left). On November 25th, 2016, they tweeted the photograph with the caption \"George Soros. A SS in the National Socialist German workers party. Nazi party. He served under Hitler. The Democratic Party soul.\" The fact that the image is not of Soros but of Groening did not slow the meme's spread. On October 18th, 2018, Facebook [7] user Pamela Perkins posted the photograph with the caption \"This is George Soros. Remember this the next time the Soros-funded liberals call you a racist, fascist, or Nazi.\" The post received more than 830 reaction, 530 comments and 69,000 shares in less than three weeks.     On October 31st, FactCheck.org[8] wrote of the conspiracy theory: Q: Is there a bogus viral meme circulating online that purports to show Holocaust survivor George Soros as a Nazi soldier?  A: It is bogus. The photo in the meme is of a Nazi guard who died earlier this year. It is not Soros.

The post received more than 23,000 views in seven years (shown below, right).  Over the next few years, the theme became internet-shorthand for a bad situation. On November 8th, 2015, Twitter user @seinfeld2000 tweeted a clip from a Donald Trump-hosted episode of Saturday Night Live. Larry David made a guest appearance on the episode, and @seinfeld2000 edited the ending of Curb Your Enthusiasm over a closeup of David at the show's conclusion. The post received more than 9,800 retweets and 14,000 likes in three years (shown below).   what if curb your enthusiasm still on tv? pic.twitter.com/ii6S9kIMug\u2014 Seinfeld Current Day (@Seinfeld2000) November 8, 2015      On December 21st, 2015, YouTuber Jake Rasmussen posted the video clip of comedian Steve Harvey's mix-up of the winning pageant at the 2015 Miss Universe ceremony, which was based on a post by YouTuber oskararnarson about 24 hours earlier[4]. The post received more than 861,000 views in three years (shown below, left). On December 22nd, Redditor SNAFU01 created the subreddit /r/memeyourenthusiasm[2] to catalog various remixes that soon followed afterward. During the 2016 United States Presidential Election, the meme was used to express the look of dread on Chris Christie's Face. On March 2nd, 2016, YouTuber Seinfeld Current Day (Seinfeld2000) posted a video mixing the press conference from the meme with the theme. The post received more than 72,000 views in less than three years (shown below, right).     On March 24th, 2016, Dan Brill and Phillip Pastore, New York City-based ad agency copywriters, launched Curb Your Enthusiasm[3], an audio-video mashup generator website that allows its user to create custom remix videos by cueing the tune during playback of any YouTube clip.  @Seinfeld2000's Response On December 24th, 2018, the New York Times interviewed Jason Richards, better known as @Seinfeld2000, on the Curb Your Enthusiasm meme. Richards, who refers to himself as \"the social media guardian of Larry David and HBO slash Warner Media\u2019s intellectual property,\" expresses the opinion that the meme is frequently misused and overused. In many of these situations, he says, the subject of the video has the power in the situation, unlike Larry David at the end of an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. Additionally, he claims that as of January 1st, 2019, he will be retiring the meme. He closes the interview by giving tips for using the meme. He says: Choose good moments. In today\u2019s always-on culture, cringe-worthy events happen all the time. Be a good editor and pick only the moments that will work best. Usually these will have to be drawn out and painful enough to accommodate the first 12 seconds of the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme and have a character suffering in the center of it all. Have you found a moment where an athlete laughs awkwardly for a moment? That\u2019s not quite right. I know, but everyone on Twitter is laughing about it. Still, be strong. A better moment will come along soon. Let the hacks take this one on.  No sloppy iPhone screen records. Download the video and open it in iMovie and use the Ken Burns effect, just like the professionals do. This is the Curb Your Enthusiasm meme, not amateur hour at Captain Johnny\u2019s Two-Cent Peanut Circus. Have some respect.  Stay true to \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\" No juxtaposing credits over the video or cutting the shape of the video square. Is that what the show is like? No. Do you even watch the show?\" Larry David's Comments In the interview, the New York Times published a comment on the meme from Curb Your Enthusiasm-creator and -star Larry David. He said in an email: \"I don't know anything about this. Every now and then someone will send me something with 'Curb' music at the end. Some of them I find mildly amusing, some not. Have never really given it any thought except for wondering why anyone would do it.\"                    Various Examples                          Search Interest     External References  [1] Wikipedia \u2013 List of Curb Your Enthusiasm Episodes [2] Reddit \u2013 /r/memeyourenthusiasm [3] Curb Your Video \u2013 Make Any Video Pretty\u2026 Pretty\u2026 Awkward [4] YouTube \u2013 oskararnarson's Post      Latest Editorial And News       How Standing On The Gravitron Became The Ultimate Meme Of Rebellion        TikToker Justine Paradise Accuses Jake Paul Of Sexual Assault        Legendary Rapper DMX Dies At 50        Maggie Goldenberger Auctioning Off Original \u2018Ermahgerd\u2019 Photo As Meme NFTs Continue Trending Online"}, "Shaun White Halloween Costume Controversy": {"image": "https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/524/shaun.jpg", "type": ["Controversy"], "origin_year": "2018", "date_added": "2018-10-31T13:49:35-04:00", "views": 5392, "videos": 0, "photos": 6, "comments": 8, "about": "Shaun White Halloween Costume Controversy refers to a public backlash against professional snowboarder and Olympic gold-medalist Shaun White for his \"Simple Jack\" Halloween costume. \"Simple Jack\" is a meta-character from the 2008 film Tropic Thunder that was meant to satirize actors but received criticism for its portrayal of people with disabilities.

They said in a statement: \"We are truly disappointed that Shaun White, an acclaimed Olympian, would choose this costume which is so offensive and causes so much pain. Disability is not a joke nor should it be a punchline. We hope that Shaun White and others learn that this just continues stigma, stereotypes and discrimination.

Instagram user @torimomma commented on the photograph, writing that they were \"incredibly heartbroken\" and \"extremely disappointed\" (shown below, left).[1] Some did not accept White's apology (shown below, center0. Twitter[4] user @RBcochrane tweeted, \"So apparently all is forgiven by Special Olympics for Shaun White's decision to make his Halloween costume a #disabled person.

The teaser gained over 1.7 million views in a matter of hours (shown below).  At E3 2018, Todd Howard revealed more details about the game, calling it a \"softcore survival\" game that will be played entirely online and a prequel to the Fallout narrative. He also discussed the game being available in an open beta starting October 23rd, 2018, and confirmed a November 14th, 2018 release date.[1]  Game-Deleting Bug On October 30th, 2018, Bethesda tweeted, \"PC #Fallout76 B.E.T.A. players: We are aware of an issue with the client and are investigating. Do not click any buttons on the client for the time being.\"[1] The \"issue\" in question turned out to be that clicking any button on the launch client led to the entire 50GB game being deleted and launching a redownload. The issue was mocked online as the worst bug a Bethesda game has ever had, and the company has been notorious for bugs in the past. User @dnannann mocked the bug and Bethesda's history in a tweet that gained over 4,700 retweets and 10,000 likes (shown below, left). User @9_volt_ also made a joke that gained over 1,200 retweets and 5,000 likes (shown below, right).     Release Fallout 76 was released November 14th, 2018. Initial reaction to the release was mostly negative. Critics were unable to review the game before it came out, and the user score on Metacritic has wavered between 2.5 and 3.0 on the first day of release,[4] though Forbes[5] warned this could be an example of \"review-bombing\", saying \"Review bombing is fairly standard operating procedure for developers that anger the hivemind in one way or another, in this case committing the sin of taking an established property in a new direction.\" Kotaku writer Ethan Gach's first impression of the game detailed frustrating situations and unresponsive controls.[6] In a Reddit post on /r/OutofTheLoop[7] user turcois asked about the hate for the game, to which user lorddrame responded with an extensive list of problems with the game, including:  - Bethesda has gone the anti-consumer route by selling an incomplete product, bugs, and selling the beta as a demo. - it is buggy, the engine clearly isn't made well for it. The FOV is locked to a level that can cause litteral, if minor, health issues for some people and the FPS is locked as the speed of some parts are tied to FPS, which is almost a cardinal sin in modern game production. - The difficulty is so low, that co-operation is discouraged. The world is very empty, little to do really outside grinding mobs that die incredibly fast and collecting loot. The quests are cookie-cutter types we have seen a million times before.  As of November 20th, the game has a critic score of 51/100 on Metacritic.[4] Additionally, pictures of a physical copy of the game released with the $200 \"power armor\" special edition of Fallout 76 revealed that the \"physical copy\" inside the game's box was a cardboard disc with a download code on it.[8] The circulating pictures led to criticism of Bethesda as selling something the player explicitly did not order on /v/[9] and Tumblr.[10]    Nuke Crash In Fallout 76, \"nuking\" a locale causes higher-level enemies to spawn and better loot to drop.[11] On November 17th, 2018, YouTuber Nickaroo93 organized the launch of three nukes at once. Shortly after the nukes go off, he is booted from the server. His video documenting the event gained over 693,000 views (shown below).  The video was widely covered by gaming and tech news sites, including The Verge,[11] PC Gamer,[12] Techspot,[13] and others. Gamestop Tantrum On November 17th, 2018, Facebook user Tarenthis Campbell posted a video of a Gamestop customer attempting to return Fallout 76. When the man behind the desk explains that a full refund is not available and he can only get store credit, the unknown customer begins pushing over displays and knocking games to the ground. The video gained over 4.4 million views on the platform (YouTube re-upload shown below).  The video was covered by Daily Dot,[14] who praised the man behind the counter for keeping a calm demeanor during the outburst. The video was also posted to Twitter by user @GeoffLife, where it gained over 18,000 retweets. A reply by @CNJcast praising the cashier gained over 1,000 likes (shown below).    Denial of Refunds On November 27th, 2018, OneAngryGamer[15] reported that after the viral Gamestop tantrum, other players reported that they couldn't receive refunds for Fallout 76 in no matter how or where they purchased it from, and that a law firm, Migliaccio & Rathod LLP, was investigating Bethesda Game Studios for deceptive trade practices. In an update on their website,[16] the law firm wrote:  Migliaccio & Rathod LLP is currently investigating Bethesda Game Studios for releasing a heavily-glitched game, Fallout 76, and refusing to issue refunds for PC purchasers of the game who found it to be unplayable because of its technical problems. While minor bugs and glitches are expected with the release of most new games, Fallout 76 launched with a 56GB patch that has proven to be but a starting point for the game\u2019s problems. Gamers who have tried to receive a refund because of the game\u2019s myriad glitches have been unable to do so since they downloaded the game, leaving them to deal with an unplayable experience until patches bring it back to a playable state.  That update was also posted to /r/pcgaming[17] where it gained over 8,600 points before being deleted for due to violating the subreddit's rules against \"self-promotion.\" The law firm was later interviewed by Vice.[18] There, they reported that they'd received over 200 calls from players who were unable to obtain a refund from Bethesda. Nylon Bag On November 28th, 2018, customers who purchased the $200 Fallout 76 Collector's Edition expressed their disappointment as they received a nylon bag with their purchase instead of the advertised, higher-quality canvas bag.[20] The backlash started spreading after user @AllGamesDelta_[19] posted about the issue, including a response from Bethesda which stated \"The bag shown in the media was a prototype and was too expensive to make. We aren\u2019t planning on doing anything about it.\"    The Fallout Twitter account responded to the user, saying the customer service employee was a temp and not directly employed by Bethesda. The account also issued an apology, providing a way for players who felt cheated by the collector's addition to receive \"500 atoms.\"     YouTuber YongYea posted a video response to the controversy, gaining over 330,000 views in less than 24 hours.  Private Information Leak On December 5th, Redditor Jessiepie[21] posted to /r/fo76 telling players he had access to their private information and the ability to edit it, writing:  I am receiving every single one of your support tickets on my Bethesda account. Mostly it's your receipts for you power armor set requesting a new bag. These receipts contain all your info. Your email and home address and the card you used to buy this extremely glitched game\u2026 I can update your ticket for you, if you'd like. And close it! How fun is that? Please rest assure I have no desire to stalk you or mess with your Fallout 76 experience.  On the Bethesda forums, user RadioactiveTrinket[22] also reported about the leak, writing:  Beware with what information you put in your tickets, cause they are basically public ! I went on the support website today, to update a ticket of mine, and surprisingly (or not\u2026) I ended up being able to see all sorts of tickets, with people putting their personnal informations in them, like receipt screenshots, names, addresses and so on. I'm assuming this is a bug in the website, because I don't see for what reason Bethesda would make tickets public.  The controversy was covered by Forbes, who noted both posts contained deleted screenshots of the problem.[23] Bethesda Support[24] tweeted about the controversy the following day with a statement saying the website was taken down immediately upon discovery of the error. The statement also said no passwords or full credit cards were leaked (shown below).     Fallout 1st and Domain Hijack  On October 23rd, 2019, Bethesda announced Fallout 1st, a premium subscription service for Fallout 76. The service, available for $12.99 per month or $99.00 per year, allows subscribers to play on private servers and offers them a number of exclusive items.[25] On the same day, an anonymous 4chan /v/ board user made a thread in which he revealed that Bethesda did not buy http://falloutfirst.com/ domain before the announcement and that he bought it instead for the purpose of ridiculing the company and the Fallout 1st subscription service.[26]    The hijacked website featured an \"Fallout Fuck You 1st\" announcement based on that posted by Bethesda on the company's website, edited as if the company was admitting to disliking its player base and to openly scamming them (screenshots shown below).     The 4chan thread gathered multiple responces within hours of being posted, with the news of the website hijack being reported by users and news outlets online in the following hours.[27][28][29]                    Online Presence The game quickly developed an online following after it was announced. A subreddit about the game has gained over 82,000 subscribers.[2] The game's Facebook page has over 4,400 likes.[3] In June of 2018, Noclip posted a 40-minute documentary to YouTube going behind the scenes of the creation of the video game, gaining over 1.5 million views (shown below).  On May 4th, 2019, YouTuber Internet Historian released a video titled \"The Fall of 76\" describing the various problems and controversies around Fallout 76's launch and its associated merchandise (shown below). The video received over 18.8 million views in fifteen months.  Take Me Home, Country Roads The song Take Me Home, Country Roads was used in the trailer of the 2018 game Fallout 76. Unlike the previous songs listed, the one used in the trailer is a cover of the original made specifically for the game.  The song started seeing increased use in memes in the spring of 2018, due to the song's use in the Fallout 76 trailer. KnowYourMeme user William, Lord of Dimentions created an Ok, Bye Mom variation referencing the song and the trailer on May 30th, 2018 (shown below, left). Additionally, memes about the song on Reddit will often feature comments referencing the game. A post on /r/memes_of_the_dank using breath in Boi has a comments section talking almost exclusively about the upcoming Fallout game.

The controversy was widely publicized online in late October 2018 after evidence emerged that conservative lobbyist Jack Burkman was involved in pushing the allegations and pro-Trump activist Jacob Wohl orchestrated the campaign through an agency named Surefire Intelligence.", "origin": "", "other_text": "Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce Vinny Sexual Misconduct Allegations        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       Background On October 30th, 2018, conservative Twitter personality Jacob Wohl, previously known for his I Just Left a Hipster Coffee Shop tweets and for being accused of defrauding investors,[3] tweeted suggesting major allegations were about to drop against Special Counsel Robert Mueller (shown below).                       Developments That day, several reporters revealed that on October 17th, they received an email with an \"urgent tip\" from a woman named \"Lorraine\" saying she had been offered money to accuse Robert Mueller of sexual misconduct.[1]    Reporters were unable to verify the claims or even existence of \"Lorraine.\" In response to Wohl's tweet, reporter Scott Stedman[2] posted his direct messages with an anonymous person \"Lorraine\" referred him to. This person was allegedly behind the payment offer, and he claimed to be working for Jack Burkman, a conservative lobbyist.     Hill Reporter[4] reported that day that the Special Counsel had alerted the FBI to a scheme to accuse Mueller of sexual misconduct. Shortly after, Jack Burkman tweeted that he was going to have a press conference with the woman accusing Mueller of sexual misconduct on November 1st (shown below).    The conservative site Gateway Pundit, in a since-deleted post, posted details of the allegations, saying they took place on August 2nd, 2010.[5] On August 2nd, 2010, The Washington Post[6] had reported that Mueller was in court for jury duty. Jacob Wohl's Involvement Speaking to Hill Reporter, Burkman linked his information to Surefire Intelligence, saying the company was run by Jacob Wohl. Wohl denied his involvement with Surefire Intelligence, but Hill Reporter verified that Wohl's email was listed SOA: RNAME record. Wohl is also a contributor to Gateway Pundit.    According to Hill Reporter's research, Surefire Intelligence was incorporated on October 9th, 2018, and its listed phone numbers \"come up empty\" and its addresses \"have no real presence.\" Twitter user Aric Toler[7] looked up Surefire Intelligence employees on LinkedIn and discovered that the photos used for the accounts were easily reverse-searched and that one of the \"employees\" of the company used a photo of actor Christoph Waltz (shown below).    NBC News[8] investigated the story and discovered that when calling Surefire Intelligence, they were redirected to another number, which turned out to be the number of Jacob Wohl's mother. Additionally, Jane Meyer of the New Yorker pointed out that the Linkedin profile for Surefire Intelligence Managing Partner Matthew Cohen appeared to be a photoshopped image of Wohl (shown below).    Jacob Wohl and the scandal earned a devoted thread on KiwiFarms where people discussed his failure to conjure credible allegations.[10] November 1st Press Conference On November 1st, Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman appeared before reporters to announce their allegations against Robert Mueller. They were scheduled to appear with the woman supposedly accusing Mueller, fashion designer Carolyne Cass, but the woman never appeared.[9] The men said the woman \"panicked\" and decided not to show and instead presented a signed affidavit that claimed Mueller raped her on August 2nd, 2010. No other evidence was given, and they stated that the Washington Post story from August 2nd, 2010 that placed Mueller at jury duty was leaked by his team. Notably, in the affidavit, Cass' name was spelled \"Carolyn\" without an \"e.\" After insisting this was the correct way to spell her name, Burkman conceded to reporters that it was spelled with an \"e\" and quipped \"Even the Declaration of Independence had misspellings.\" The pair, who had previously said they had seven women accusing Mueller, later conceded this was not the case. They could not answer questions about Mueller's security detail during the supposed day of assault, how Wohl knew Cass, or about the allegations that the women involved had reported that they had been offered money to make false allegations against Mueller. After the conference, Gateway Pundit founder Jim Hoft stated the site had suspended its relationship with Wohl. At one point, Burkman stated that Wohl was \"a child prodigy that has eclipsed Mozart.\" Jacob Wohl vs. Chrissy Teigen On October 30th, reacting to Jacob Wohl's name trending, model Chrissy Teigen tweeted,[11] \"can someone break down with jacob wohl did in one tweet. like a cliffs note please \u2013 my timeline is a mess I don\u2019t have the energy.\" The tweet received more than 800 retweets and 21,000 likes in three days.    Two days later, Wohl responded to the post by tweeting at Teigen, \"I became more famous than you. That\u2019s what happened.\" Additionally, Wohl included a Google Trends breakdown of the search interest. The post received more than 100 retweets and 1,000 likes in 24 hours (shown below, left). Teigen responded,[12] \"This is literally just a graph proving people had to google your dumbass to figure out who you are.\" The tweet received more than 33,000 retweets and 319,000 likes in 24 hours (shown below, right). On November 1st, The Daily Dot [13] reported on the conversation.     On February 26th, 2019, USA Today[14] published a profile on Wohl that included a statement from Carolyne Cass, the accuser in the Mueller allegations. In the article, she claimed that she met Wohl on Craigslist, and he proceeded to trick her into convincing her that he was an investigator named Matthew Cohen. Cass went on to say that the document accusing Mueller was made up by Wohl. That day, Daily Beast[15] writer Will Sommer tweeted the excerpt from the article with the caption \"Remember Jacob Wohl's disastrous press conference smearing Robert Mueller? His Mueller accuser now says Jacob tricked her and made it all up.\" The post recived more than 1,400 retweets and 3,100 comments in 24 hours (shown below).

The Obvious collective used the code to create the painting which sold at Christie's. Speaking to The Verge, Hugo Caselles-Dupr\u00e9, the tech lead for Obvious, admitted that Obvious used Barrat's code but tweaked it to fit the collective's taste.

Others came to Obvious' defense, as Barrat made the code open on GitHub, making legal routes for Barrat limited. Barrat iterated to Daily Dot[3] that he did not want to take legal action against Obvious, saying \"My main concern is just that actual artists working with AI get more recognition, and don\u2019t get shadowed over by this collective of marketers and their recent sale.\"                        Search Interest                        External References  [1] Twitter \u2013 ChristiesInc [2] The Verge \u2013 HOW THREE FRENCH STUDENTS USED BORROWED CODE TO PUT THE FIRST AI PORTRAIT IN CHRISTIE\u2019S [3] Daily Dot \u2013 Drama ensues over first-ever AI-created artwork sold in a major auction--and its $432,500 grab      Latest Editorial And News       How Standing On The Gravitron Became The Ultimate Meme Of Rebellion        TikToker Justine Paradise Accuses Jake Paul Of Sexual Assault        Legendary Rapper DMX Dies At 50        Maggie Goldenberger Auctioning Off Original \u2018Ermahgerd\u2019 Photo As Meme NFTs Continue Trending Online"}, "You Get Used To It": {"image": "https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/509/You_get_used.png", "type": ["Exploitable", "Photoshop"], "origin_year": "2018", "date_added": "2018-10-30T11:05:04-04:00", "views": 44329, "videos": 0, "photos": 83, "comments": 6, "about": "You Get Used To It refers to a popular scene of the anime Goblin Slayer, which gained notoriety for being used as an Object Labeling meme and as a Reaction Image using the Priestess and High Elf character's expression.", "origin": "On October 27th, 2018 the fourth episode of the Goblin slayer anime premiered in which the Goblin slayer's group enter a ruin to hunt a group of goblins.

Within 24 hours, the announcement tweet received more than 134,000 likes and 108,000 retweets.    On October 16th, 2016, the video game news site GamesRadar published an article arguing that Red Dead Redemption 2 should be set in the modern day rather than the Old West. The following day, Redditor BerserkWolfUK posted a screenshot of the headline titled \"When you sigh so hard you spit out your tonsils\" to /r/gaming, where it gathered upwards of 7,500 votes (85% upvoted) and 970 comments. Meanwhile, a post complaining about the article was submitted to /r/KotakuInAction.    On October 20th, 2016, Rockstar debuted the first trailer for the game (shown below).  While the game was initially announced for the Fall of 2017, it would not come out until one year later, on October 26th, 2018.                    Controversies 100-hour Work Week Statements On October 14th, 2018, Vulture published a piece on the development of Red Dead Redemption 2. In the piece, Rockstar cofounder Dan Houser said that in getting the most intricate aspects of the game correct, members of the development team would often work 100-hour weeks. The piece reads:  The polishing, rewrites, and reedits Rockstar does are immense. \u201cWe were working 100-hour weeks\u201d several times in 2018, Dan says. The finished game includes 300,000 animations, 500,000 lines of dialogue, and many more lines of code. Even for each RDR2 trailer and TV commercial, \u201cwe probably made 70 versions, but the editors may make several hundred. Sam and I will both make both make lots of suggestions, as will other members of the team.\u201d  The idea of \"100-hour work weeks\" led to concerns about unfair working conditions at Rockstar Games. Houser clarified to Kotaku what he meant by the comment, saying:  The point I was trying to make in the article was related to how the narrative and dialogue in the game was crafted, which was mostly what we talked about, not about the different processes of the wider team. After working on the game for seven years, the senior writing team, which consists of four people, Mike Unsworth, Rupert Humphries, Lazlow and myself, had, as we always do, three weeks of intense work when we wrapped everything up\u2026 More importantly, we obviously don\u2019t expect anyone else to work this way. Across the whole company, we have some senior people who work very hard purely because they\u2019re passionate about a project, or their particular work, and we believe that passion shows in the games we release. But that additional effort is a choice, and we don\u2019t ask or expect anyone to work anything like this.  The comments nevertheless led to widespread discussion about heavy overtime in the video games industry, referred to as \"Crunch\" by those in the business. Twitter Moments compiled numerous Twitter users' opinions on and experiences with Crunch, including a thread by Jenn Sandercock in which she relayed her story about working at a AAA game development company that chastised her for baking cakes for coworkers so they could take a 30 minute break once a week.     Shirrako Gaming YouTube Ban On October 31st, 2018, YouTuber Shirrako uploaded a video titled \"Red Dead Redemption 2 \u2013 Annoying Feminist Fed to Alligator,\" featuring footage from the game in which the player lassos a women's suffrage activist and feeds her to an alligator in a swamp. The video has since been removed, but was subsequently reuploaded by other users (shown below).  On November 5th, the Vice news site Motherboard[9] published an article titled \"Red Dead Redemption 2 Players Are Excited to Attack and Kill Feminists in the Game,\" which criticized Shirrako's videos. The article included an interview with Shirrako, addressing why the video was created:  \"I know you're probably expecting some political answer but the truth is it was simply a funny moment from one of my streams which I've decided to upload as a separate video. Not sure if it was intentional by Rockstar Games but the NPC is made to be rather annoying, when you try to shop for clothing in the game, your dialogue with the shop keeper keeps being interrupted by her shouting, so I simply wanted to shop in peace, I'm sure that as a gamer you're familiar with these annoying NPC situations.\"  On November 7th, Shirrako tweeted[7] that his channel had been banned for posting the video, and released screenshots of the email sent to him from YouTube.[6]    That day, YouTuber Keemstar tweeted a video denouncing the channel's ban, saying that it made no sense to censor channels for killing people in video games (shown below).

Development Suspect Robert Bowers Local authorities identified the suspect as Robert Bowers, a 46-year-old resident of Baldwin, Pennsylvania (photograph below, left). He was taken into police custody after the shooting and transported to a hospital. Bowers has been charged with 29 federal criminal counts, including obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs, which is a hate crime, and using a firearm to commit murder. The counts include \"11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death; 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during a crime of violence; four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence\".[5] Bowers's Gab social media profile was registered in January 2018 under the handle \"onedingo\" made numerous references of violence towards Jews and refugees, particularly those at the U.S.-Mexico border. The account's description read, \"jews are the children of satan. (John 8:44) - - the lord jesus christ is come in the flesh.\" Leading up to the attack, Bowers referenced Jewish refugee advocacy group Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) on Gab, posting a list of Shabbat or sabbath services held on behalf of refugees, which included \"a Shabbat address that is less than a mile away from the Tree of Life Synagogue.\"[6] Five minutes prior to the police being alerted to the shooting, Bowers posted on Gab that \"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in\" (shown below, right).     Online Reaction The shooting became the subject of various discussions on Reddit. On October 27th, 2018, Redditor[8] TheMiddleGround777 posted the Vox article \"The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting comes amid a years long rise in anti-Semitism\" in the /r/politics subreddit. The post received more than 2,500 points (96% upvoted) and 400 comments. That day, Redditor[9] NotherDayAnotherDoug posted an image featuring Peter Griffin from the American animated situational comedy Family Guy, satirizing the perception of white terrorists in the United States. The post received more than 6,700 points (92% upvoted) and 290 comments (shown below, left). The following day, Redditor[10] gangbangkang posted the \"Pittsburgh Steelers tribute to the victims of yesterday's synagogue shooting\" in the /r/sports subreddit. The post received more than 58,000 points (86% upvoted) and 1,400 comments (shown below, right).     Gab De-Platforming Following reports that Bowers had busing the social media website Gab to share antisemitic beliefs, various companies began cutting ties with Gab, including PayPal, who told the Verge[12] \"The company is diligent in performing reviews and taking account actions. When a site is explicitly allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action.\" Additionally, Joynet, Gab's hosting provider, and Gab's payment processor, Stripe, also began cutting ties with the company. Finally, GoDaddy gave Gab 24 hours to find a new domain or the site would be suspended.[13] In response to the \"no-platforming\" of Gab, the company tweeted,[14] \"The left couldn\u2019t control Gab. The media couldn\u2019t control Gab. Venture capitalists couldn\u2019t control Gab. Advertisers couldn\u2019t control Gab. Whining activists couldn\u2019t control Gab. Big Tech couldn\u2019t control Gab. So Gab needed to be smeared and taken offline at all costs.\" The tweet received more than 1,200 retweets and 2,300 likes in 24 hours (shown below, left). On October 29th, the company tweeted,[15] \"Gab has spent the past 48 hours proudly working with the DOJ and FBI to bring justice to an alleged terrorist. Because of the data we provided, they now have plenty of evidence for their case. Please pray for all involved and the victims.\" The post received more than 345 retweets and 790 likes in 24 hours (shown below, right).     Speaking to Gizmodo,[13] Michael Edison Hayden, an open source intelligence analyst at Storyful, criticized Gab and referred to it as a hub of right-wing radicalization. He said: Andrew Torba, the CEO of Gab, will get angry when people for call his site a white nationalist website or an alt-right website but anyone who spends time on it knows that it\u2019s a haven for extremists. Violent white supremacist groups like Patriot Front and Atomwaffen Division organize out in the open on Gab. Users frequently call for the murder of women, Jews and other minorities on Gab, and are rewarded with likes and reposts\u2026.[Charleston, South Carolina church shooter] Dylann Roof is treated as a hero by many Gab users.\" Government Response Speaking to reporters, United States President Donald Trump said that the shooting could have been prevented had the synagogue hired armed protection.[3] He said: \"If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better. If they had some kind of protection within the temple it could have been a much better situation. They didn\u2019t [\u2026] This is a case where if they had an armed guard inside they may have been able to stop him immediately, maybe there would have been nobody killed, except for him maybe.\" He continued: \"I think one thing we should do is to stiffen up our laws in terms of the death penalty. I think they should stiffen up laws and i think they should very much stiffen up the laws [\u2026] It\u2019s a terrible terrible thing what\u2019s going on with hate in our country frankly and all over the world, and something has to be done.\"   Michael Eisenberg, a former president of Tree of Life \u2013 Or L'Simcha congregation, said that the synagogue did have a police presence on the High Holy Days but that \"on a day like today, the door is open. It's a religious service, you could walk in and out.\"[4] Hours after the shooting, President Trump was criticized for retweeting Dinesh D'souza, a controversial right-wing filmmaker, who has been accused of promoting racist and antisemitic sentiments in the past (shown below).[7]    Letter to President Trump from Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Following his comments, a group of Jewish leaders from Pittsburgh that are affiliated with the Bend The Arc Jewish action organization wrote a letter to Trump. They wrote: For the past three years your words and your policies have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement. You yourself called the murderer evil, but yesterday\u2019s violence is the direct culmination of your influence.    President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism.  Our Jewish community is not the only group you have targeted.  You have also deliberately undermined the safety of people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Yesterday\u2019s massacre is not the first act of terror you incited against a minority group in our country.    President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you stop targeting and endangering all minorities.  The murderer\u2019s last public statement invoked the compassionate work of the Jewish refugee service HIAS at the end of a week in which you spread lies and sowed fear about migrant families in Central America. He killed Jews in order to undermine the efforts of all those who find shared humanity with immigrants and refugees.  President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you cease your assault on immigrants and refugees.  The Torah teaches that every human being is made b\u2019tzelem Elohim, in the image of God.  This means all of us. On October 28th, when asked about whether or not Trump is welcome in Pittsburgh (video below), Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said, \"That\u2019s really up to the families themselves.\"[18]  That day, Twitter[17] user @igorvolsky tweeted, \"Jewish leaders in #Pittsburgh pen powerful letter to Trump. -- 'President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism.' -- 'President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you stop targeting and endangering all minorities.'\" The post received more than 9,200 retweets and 18,000 likes in three days (shown below).    That day, Redditor[11] slingtarp posted \"Jewish leaders tell Trump he's not welcome in Pittsburgh until he denounces white nationalism\" in the /r/politics subreddit.

The post received more than 63,000 views in seven years.    On June 6th, 2018, Redditor [5] Somf_machine posted an English translation of the interview. They wrote: \"Mr. Ice: I made up the name myself, so it's mine, patent-registered on me, mmmh, so I basically started here \u2013 by myself, Frank wasn't there \u2013 to design the skull.

I don't understand that word, at all) but also the peace maker type.\"  Mr. Geissen: You want to be called 'Ice', why 'Ice'?  Mr. Ice: That's right, because it's my name which I actually use now. (cut) Because Mr. Cool always somehow seemed very\u2026 cool to me and since I dig Vanilla Ice I added the 'Ice'.  Mr. Geissen: Please turn around\u2026 a very interesting part of your body is your back and it says: MR COOL ICE!!! Why?  Mr. Ice: I just wanted to represent something (cut) I wanted something which is mine, something because a lot of people wear brands or represent things which are, well, I'd say it's just put-on.  Voice-over: Thomas Steinberger aka Mr. Cool Ice loves public appearances. In the pedestrian zone and on tv. The 33 year old man from Mainz got his body in shape for that reason, and had his own logo tattooed [on himself]. A t-shirt shop helped him with the design.  T-Shirt guy (named Josef): He came into the shop, all casual, approached me, came straight to the point and, well, then we did it together and it was actually funny. It first seemed a bit crazy, having to design a tattoo in Corel Draw, since we usually only do t-shirts, but since it was for Ice \u2013 who we already know for quite some time, right?  Mr. Ice: I made up the name myself, so it's mine, patent-registered on me, mmmh, so I basically started here \u2013 by myself, Frank wasn't there \u2013 to design the skull.

T-Shirt guy: We designed his business cards together, for example\u2026  Mr. Ice: I want people to ask, to think about it, if it's true; that's why it says on the top: Mr Lover Lover\u2026 below I put Mr. Sex because that's my motto, that I love sex. 'just cool and geil ('geil' is a stupid word which is basically used in the sense of 'cool, awesome', but also means 'horny')', that is for the stupid people who always think they have to put me in categories, which doesn't work anyway.  Voice-over: He already spent 4000\u20ac on his tattoos \u2013 according to Ice this investment in his body was worth it. Actually he only wanted to have a few jackets printed \u2013 the thing with the tattoos was more or less coincidence.  Mr. Ice: I didn't really decide on it, I was \u2026 I accompanied a buddy who always wanted a tattoo \u2013 who by the way hasn't got one to this day \u2013 and uhm\u2026 was taken by surprise by the tattoo artist, who said: 'so, your appointment is in two weeks' and I was 'uhm uh\u2026' \u2026 yeah, and the problem is, after your first one \u2026 not necessarily, but.. you get addicted. A tattoo is something you'll have your whole life. You should put a lot of thought in it and know if you just do it on a whim or because everybody else does it or to express something, how do I want to express it, where, on what body\u2026 I say, I'm Mr. Cool Ice, that's my name, my thing and won't ruin it, because\u2026 it's my whole body, it's my person and where I don't get away with it, I'm out of place anyway, because I don't want to be there.  Voice: Are there moments when you wish you didn't have any tattoos?  Mr. Ice: No.  Voice: Never?  Mr. Ice: As soon as I get up and see myself in the mirror, no. Some might say it's narcissistic, but as I say to myself, to do something like that you have to be a bit narcissistic.  Voice-over: Mr. Cool Ice \u2013 he's used that name for 13 years and for 5 years now it's also on his body.  Mr. Cool Ice: (sentence I don't understand) Even without tattoos, because some say I only got the tattoos to draw attention to myself\u2026 so, a long time ago, I had longer hair and stuff, but I was as crazy as I am now, because a lot of people only see craziness in the tattoos or the name, but that's not true. Maybe I changed on the outside, but my character and way of thought, towards other people or regarding my life, that never changed.  Voice-over: in contrast to the colorful shows on tv, Ice prefers tidiness, discipline and housekeeping at home.  Mr. Ice: So, it always looks very clean. And down here, there's nothing hidden, all the cleaning supplies you see.. yeah, it's very very very very clean. At my place it's clean, clean, clean! In my bathroom, worse than a woman\u2026 there's everything you need, toothbrush\u2026 toothbrush for visitors, very important, because I hate visiting other places and there's no toothbrush. And no matter how drunk, you should have a deodorant. not just for yourself, but for the others too. A toilet should also be as clean as it is down here. To all guys: sit, don't stand. Because everybody who cleans up himself, knows how\u2026 talk show  woman: Mr. Cool Ice will be very happy to appear here on stage, because he describes himself as a male minx. hellooooo~ random blah blah, blonde woman sitting beside him: you're ugly! \u2013 Mr. Ice: That's relative, isn't it. \u2013 blonde: horrible, horrible. say, what do you have here\u2026 talk show woman: what exactly is it a real minx does in your opinion?  Mr. ice: A minx is for me\u2026 a woman who stands her ground (and something more which I can't translate) \u2013 'geil', dirty, arrogant but with style and she maybe doesn't have that. (cut) I'm not a womanizer, I'm not macho, I'm not a sexbomb, I always say I enjoy ladies. and the other way round. And I don't mean women have to do all the chores, that would be too boring and I myself already clean up enough and like it\u2026 Sex is very important to me, not on top of the list, but in second place and very big. because if it doesn't work sexually, even if the character or the whole person is great, it won't work out. Because I'm a cheerful and above all sexual person\u2026 I don't mean I have to have one-night stands, or only half a year or a relationship forever, the only thing I can say for sure is that I don't want to marry. I always say, my philosophy concerning marriage and getting children is: getting married with 90, getting two children and dying with 120. Fidelity! Fidelity is very important, but basically\u2026 things you don't want, don't do to other people and let others live\u2026 don't smother. For God's sake. The longest relationship was three years. I was faithful in every relationship. So, I had relationships, well, you can't call them relationships, I enjoyed ladies I wasn't together with\u2026 and that (\u2026 I think he says something which means three at the same time\u2026 but not in the foursome sense. ahem.) but you have to be honest\u2026  Voice: How many ladies have you enjoyed so far? Mr. Ice: Well. That's something I usually negate when people ask me. I always say, I love the ladies and then\u2026 stupid gesture (this guy really doesn't make sense sometimes.)  voice-over: His body is his everything, so Ice works out regularly, five times a week.  Mr. Ice: Fitness is awesome. totally brilliant and I recommend it to everyone, yeah, I'm against drugs of all kinds\u2026 well, I do drink alcohol sometimes, sometimes one over the eight, but when it comes to cigarettes, pills, heroin, and so on \u2013 no. I already work out for a couple of years and some might say, hey, you should have a really grandiose body by now, but since I don't take drugs and partly worked out at home for a while, it's all natural.

He also competed in other Ocarina of Time speedrun categories and performed speedruns of Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko. During this time, Frogburt gained a small audience on Twitch where he live-streamed his speedruns. On YouTube, one of Frogburt's early Twitch viewers (fellow speedrunner ikswozol) uploaded a number of clips from Frogburt's Twitch stream in which Frogburt shared interesting personal stories from his life. This series of stories became known as \"Tales of Highburt\" and are affectionately enjoyed by his earliest fans.[5] Sometime prior to June 10th, 2016, Frogburt deactivated his Twitch channel, later rebranding himself as Apollo Legend.[1] Apollo Legend launched his YouTube channel on June 10th, 2016. His initial video uploads mostly consisted of \"speedrun highlight\" videos \u2013 Apollo gathered various clips of speedrunners from their Twitch streams and then compiled the clips into highlight videos. Apollo ended up unlisting/privating/deleting a lot of these earlier videos and he moved on to a different style of video, but he inspired a number of other speedrun highlight channels such as gladJonas and Speedrun Fails. After moving to his new video style, one of Apollo's first videos of notoriety is his thoughts and criticism of GamesDoneQuick staff banning speedrunner Bonesaw577 from GDQ events in 2017, following his well received, yet controversial speedrun at SummerGamesDoneQuick 2016. He would later upload a controversial but highly viewed critique of famous speedrunner Cosmo Wright's downfall after her transition to Narcissa Wright (both shown below).    Apollo then made some viral videos that exposed Todd Rogers and Billy Mitchell, two competitive gamers who cheated a number of famous video game world records. Apollo himself did not initially discover the cheating of Todd and Billy, but his videos brought the cases to mainstream attention and did some independent investigation.                    Reputation When Apollo first started his channel with his speedrun highlight videos, he received backlash from various speedrunners \u2013 some claimed that his videos portrayed speedrunners in too much of a bad light, and others did not like Apollo using their Twitch clips within his videos. This is likely part of what prompted him to move on to different styles of videos. Apollo Legend gained notoriety for his generally outspoken criticisms of the speedrunning community. Notable criticism has been directed towards GamesDoneQuick and the handling of their events, as documented in his videos about his non-support for the GDQ events and the alleged shady behavior of its event director (shown below).    Apollo has always been a contentious figure due to his controversial videos and the controversy around Oceanside, his planned speedrunning event. However, he generally gained significant support due to his videos that brought the cheating of \"Todd Rogers\" and \"Billy Mitchell\" to light.  Todd Rogers Feud In 2017, Todd Rogers (one of the first competitive gamers and speedrunners) came under heavy pressure after his classic world records (documented in the TwinGalaxies speedrun/high score database) started to come under scrutiny. Todd's most famous speedrun record was his Dragster 5.51 record from 1982. In 2017, a speedrunner and computer scientist called Omnigamer was able to prove that Todd's alleged record of 5.51 seconds is impossible. This sparked an extremely long thread on the TwinGalaxies forum in which many people argued about whether Todd's records should be removed from the TwinGalaxies database or not, and many posters chose to deny the highly conclusive evidence against Todd. Apollo saw fit to dig deeper into Todd Rogers, and he was able to uncover a number of other nefarious activities in Todd's past. When Apollo uploaded his expos\u00e9 video of Todd in February of 2018, it quickly garnered widespread attention and over a million views. This caused TwinGalaxies to come under a lot more pressure \u2013 they could no longer delay dealing with the issue and finally removed all of Todd's records from their database. Todd was also permanently banned from TwinGalaxies. Apollo was interviewed by Keemstar on an episode of DramaAlert to discuss the story (shown below).   Billy Mitchell Feud Soon after Todd Rogers was exposed for cheating, other suspicious competitive gamers started to come under scrutiny too. One of Todd's greatest friends/associates, Billy Mitchell, was soon discovered to have cheated a number of his famous Donkey Kong high score records. A post by xelnia on the donkeykongforum website revealed that Billy used an emulator (MAME) to perform his records, whereas he claimed to have used a real arcade machine.[6] It is likely that Billy used TAS (tool-assisted speedrun) techniques to forge his records, which is notoriously easy to do with emulators like MAME. After the success of his videos regarding Todd Rogers, Apollo Legend jumped on the opportunity to expose the new evidence against Billy Mitchell in his video titled \"World's Most Infamous Donkey Kong Player Caught Cheating!\" (shown below).  Just like his videos on Todd Rogers, Apollo's expos\u00e9 of Billy Mitchell garnered much attention and views, bringing the story into mainstream light. Billy was very cautious about properly responding to the allegations publicly, so Apollo attempted to get answers straight from Mitchell himself at one of his public appearances at \"KOK Retro Arcade Night\" in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on February 25th, 2018. Apollo planned to make a follow-up video on the case using footage from the KOK Retro Arcade Night event. However, Apollo disappeared from all social media, and his planned follow-up video on Billy Mitchell was never released. Then on March 15th, 2018, TwinGalaxies reported a rumor that Apollo Legend was potentially being sued by Mitchell, with the article being revised a week later.[2] Apollo's abrupt disappearance from the internet gave credence to this rumor, but Apollo finally resurfaced on the internet again about 1.5 months later in April, and the rumor seemed to be false. On the 14th of April 2018, Apollo met Billy Mitchell again at another public appearance at Midwest Gaming Classic in Wisconsin, where he recorded more footage. At this event, Billy finally released a public statement about the allegations against him, but his statement was still very vague:  Following this statement from Mitchell, Apollo was again expected to release a follow-up video about the topic using footage from the events where they met. However, still the follow-up video was never released and Apollo soon disappeared from the internet again, until suddenly returning on the 30th of November 2018 with a new video discussing the legality of the Smash Box controller, a modified Gamecube controller with an arcade stick layout, within speedrunning. On April 12th, 2018, TwinGalaxies released an article that announced their decision to ban Billy Mitchell and remove all of his records from their database.[3] Oceanside Event Controversy Apollo Legend set out to create his own speedrun marathon event, no doubt partly because of his dissatisfaction with GamesDoneQuick. The event was called Oceanside and was planned to run from April 20-22 2018, featuring a number of high profile speedrunners. In 2017, Apollo released a trailer and a GoFundMe page for Oceanside, in which he attempted to raise $20,000 for the event. Apollo had been getting many views on some of his recent videos, but these views failed to convert to Oceanside donations as he had hoped \u2013 he was only able to raise a few hundred dollars on GoFundMe. Many people were suspicious about the ability of Apollo to organize the event successfully due to his lack of experience, and people were not confident enough to trust him with their donations. This sparked many parody videos of the Oceanside trailer, such as the following parody called \"APOLLO LEGEND OCEANSIDE EXPOSED\" by Speedrun Memes on YouTube:  Despite the lack of GoFundMe donations, Apollo Legend was able to gather enough funds to pay for the rest of Oceanside out of his own pocket, largely due to the profit from his hugely successful video \"10 Speedrunners Who Were Caught Cheating\". This video was uploaded on December 13th, 2017 and has over 8 million views as of November 22nd, 2018 (which is also his most popular video as of November 22nd, 2018). However, in February of 2018, a number of high profile speedrunners such as Cheese05 and Calebhart42 dropped out of the event. This is because they were signed by an esports organization known as beastcoast, and beastcoast did not want them to attend Oceanside for undisclosed reasons. Also in February of 2018, Apollo entered his feud with Billy Mitchell, which further distracted him from Oceanside. The rumor of potential legal action from Billy Mitchell surely pressured Apollo further. Apollo did not release many updates about Oceanside and the state of the event became more and more unclear. Then, on April 20th, 2018 (the planned start date of Oceanside), Reddit user u/Chivesmaster made a thread revealing an email from Apollo Legend. The email was sent to everybody who donated to Oceanside on GoFundMe, stating that Oceanside was cancelled and offering a refund (shown below).[4]    In Apollo's statement, he says \"Due to a recent mistake I made, I was unable to fund Oceanside as I had previously\" and \"This was my big plan for the year but messed it up by jeopardizing my financial security\". What \"mistake\" Apollo made and the details of his financial situation remains unclear, but it is likely that Apollo was referring to the possibility of having to pay for legal support due to legal threats from Billy Mitchell. This statement was his last in the public eye until his sudden return on the 30th of November 2018 when he uploaded a new video. Disappearance and Reappearance of Apollo Legend Since Apollo Legend disappeared from the public eye in April 2018 (immediately after the cancellation of Oceanside and the feud with Billy Mitchell, discussed above), there had been much confusion and speculation about what happened to him and if he would return or not. On August 16th 2018, after receiving many questions about Apollo, erudite speedrunner RWhiteGoose (one of Apollo's good friends in the speedrunning community) uploaded a video to explain all that he knew about Apollo's disappearance and the events leading up to it:  Apollo then suddenly returned on the 30th of November 2018 with his video \"Should The Smash Box Be Allowed For Speedrunning?\" Then Apollo did a stream on the following day in which he answered questions, stating that he disappeared due to pressure from the cancellation of Oceanside and legal threats from Billy Mitchell (although he was not actually sued by Billy). He stated that there was no other particular reason for his disappearance and that he thinks he should have communicated the situation better. DarkViperAU and EZScape feud On December 26th 2018, DarkViperAU uploaded a video entitled \"Apollo Legend Lies For Ad Revenue\". This was the beginning of a long-standing feud as DarkViper would go on to publish a total of 6 videos criticising Apollo Legend over the next 1.5 years.  While Apollo still had many supporters, these videos gained traction and damaged his reputation amongst some people. Then, in 2020, EZScape also released a video criticising Apollo Legend for various things. Primarily, EZScape called out Apollo for a GoFundMe campaign he had previously launched and received approximately $20,000 from to fund a lawsuit against Billy Mitchell. The lawsuit never came to fruition but it appeared the money had not been refunded, causing speculation that Apollo had effectively stolen the money. Soon after, many people started to report that they had received refunds from the GoFundMe, so EZScape unlisted his video. Furthermore, DarkViperAU unlisted his videos criticising Apollo Legend after Apollo's death (explained in the \"Suicide and Death\" section). Suicide and Death On the 30th of December 2020, Apollo Legend uploaded a video to YouTube entitled \"READ DESCRIPTION, VERY IMPORTANT\" after being inactive for months. The description contained a download link to another video, which was effectively a suicide note. In this video (approximately 8 minutes long), Apollo said he was about to commit suicide due to several severe and incurable physical health problems, as well as severe mental health problems. In the description of the video, he mentioned that he had scoliosis which caused his \"back, hips and shoulders to ache constantly\". He also mentioned that he vomits every day, and had further even worse problems that he was not comfortable talking about. In the video, he claimed that his physical health issues had been getting worse and would continue to get worse throughout his life, and that he would \"rather just leave while I still have some dignity\". Apollo also wrote in the description \"Thank you to DarkViper and EZScape for giving me the final push that I needed\", referring to two other YouTubers he had previously feuded with. This instigated further drama in the speedrun YouTube community, with people arguing about DarkViper and EZScape's level of responsibility for the suicide. However, it appears that health problems were by far the primary reason for Apollo's suicide, and the line about DarkViper and EZScape was simply a final jab from Apollo as he decided to let it all out in his final moments. Soon after, various people such as @TheSpectreRep on Twitter called Apollo's local police department, after which a deputy confirmed that Apollo had been found deceased.

In a lawsuit filed March 6th, 2018 to a Los Angeles court,[1] adult film actor Stormy Daniels claims that the hush agreement she had with Trump is non-binding because Trump never signed the document. Attached to the lawsuit is the full hush agreement negotiated between Trump, Daniels, and Cohen. The agreement uses pseudonyms--Trump's pseudonym is \"David Dennison\" and Daniels' is \"Peggy Peterson.\" A side letter agreement reveals the true names. \"David Dennison\" did not sign the agreement as \"Peggy Peterson\" had on October 28th, 2016. Because of this omission, Daniels believes she is free to discuss the affair she had with Trump. The inclusion of Trump in the agreement undermines Cohen's claim that he had paid the hush money out of his own pocket without Trump's knowledge.[2] Additionally, the lawsuit came one day after The Wall Street Journal[3] reported that Cohen's payment to Daniels was marked as suspicious by the Treasury Department and that Cohen had privately complained that he had not been reimbursed for the hush money. The morning of March 7th, Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti appeared on The Today Show to discuss the lawsuit. He alleged that Daniels and Trump did have an affair and argued it was \"ludicrous\" for Cohen to suggest Trump did not know about the payment.  Watch savannahguthrie</a>&#39;s full interview with Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels\u2019 lawyer <a href=\"https://t.co/8koWFXvYh1\">pic.twitter.com/8koWFXvYh1</a></p>&mdash; TODAY (TODAYshow) March 7, 2018    Fight With Donald Trump Jr. On October 9th, 2018, NBC News media reporter Dylan Byers tweeted that Stormy Daniels lawyer Michael Avenatti proposed a three-round mixed martial arts fight with Donald Trump Jr., with all proceeds going to charity (shown below, left). That day, Avenatti tweeted \"I'm in\" and that 50% of his portion of the proceeds would be directed to \"rebuiling Puerto Rico\" and 50% would go toward the anti-sexual violence organization RAINN (shown below, right).     Reputation Avenatti is known for his brash personality and willingness to respond to criticism and insults. On April 7th, 2018, the Los Angeles Times[4] published an article entitled \"Trump meets his match: Stormy Daniels' combative lawyer Michael Avenatti.\" They wrote: \"Michael Avenatti, the newly famous lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, has more than a few things in common with President Trump.  He's brash. He's media savvy. He enjoys the high life. He revels in antagonizing opponents.  In short, Trump may have met his match in this Newport Beach lawyer whose client, now America's best-known stripper, is suing the president to break free of a deal that bars her from discussing what she says was a one-night stand with Trump in 2006.  With a swagger worthy of the young Trump who barged his way into New York's tabloids decades ago, Avenatti has spent weeks shuttling among Manhattan TV studios to taunt the president and his fixer Michael Cohen.  His pugnacious edge makes Avenatti a natural on cable news.\"                    Controversies \"White Male\" Comments On October 25th, 2018, Avenatti was quoted in a Time[5] magazine profile on his potential 2020 presidential bid saying that the 2020 candidate \"better be a white male.\" He said: \"I think it better be a white male. When you have a white male making the arguments, they carry more weight. Should they carry more weight? Absolutely not. But do they? Yes.\" That day, Avenatti's comments and his character were the subject of much criticism on Twitter, where people expressed their disappointment and negative impression of the lawyer (examples below).       Avenatti later claimed that he had been \"misquoted\" in the profile.[6] He said: \"I was misquoted, and it was taken out of context.\"  \"A big tenet of my speeches is that we need more white men standing up and speaking up to defend women and minorities. When they do that, it carries weight among other white men.\" Domestic Violence Arrest On November 14th, 2018, TMZ[7] reported that Avenatti had been arrested by LAPD officers for domestic violence after allegedly leaving his estranged wife \"swollen and bruised.\" According to the article, his wife ran out of his apartment while yelling \"I can't believe you did this to me\" while talking on her cellphone. Avenatti allegedly chased after her while yelling \"she hit me first\" and \"this is bullshit.\" That day, BuzzFeed News reporter Brandon Wall tweeted that Avenatti had been \"arrested for domestic violence\" and was in police custody in Los Angeles (shown below).    The following day, Avenatti posted a tweet calling out Jacob Wohl and Surefire Intelligence (shown below).[8]    Nike Extortion Arrest and Bank Fraud Charges On March 25th, 2019, Avenatti was arrested for attempting to extort more than $20 million from Nike, threatening that if he did not receive the payment, he would release damaging information on the company.[9][10] It later came out that his co-conspirator was Mark Geragos, who represents Colin Kaepernick, a Nike-sponsored athlete.[11] The day prior to his arrest, Avenatti tweeted that he would be holding a press conference regarding a scandal about Nike (shown below). He also faces charges of bank fraud and wire fraud in California, after allegedly embezzling a client's money to pay his own debts.[12]    Stormy Daniels responded to the news by saying she was \"saddened but not shocked\" by the arrest (shown below). The two had ended their legal relationship a month prior. If convicted in New York, Avenatti could face a maximum of 50 years in prison.[9]    Charges On April 11th, 2019, federal prosecutors in California announced \"the filing of a 36-count indictment naming Michael Avenatti.\"[15] These charges included hiding a $4 million settlement from a mentally ill paraplegic person.[16] If convicted on all charges, Avenatti faces a maximum of 335 years in prison.[16] Avenatti tweeted \u201cI am entitled to a FULL presumption of innocence and am confident that justice will be done once ALL of the facts are known,\u201d but the tweet has since been deleted. On April 29th, Avenatti pleaded not guilty to all charges and a trial date was set for June 25th.[18] He has yet to secure legal council.    Nate Silver joked that Avenatti was in a race with Jacob Wohl to see who could commit the most crimes (shown below, left). Ben Shapiro also compared Avenatti to Wohl in a joke saying they would end up in their own version of Orange Is the New Black (shown belo, right).     Relation to NXVIM Cult Case On March 27th, 2019, the judge in the NXVIM case, Nicholas Garaufis, asked the defense team of Claire Bronfam, heiress to the Seagrams liquor heiress accused of bankrolling the cult, if they had been in contact with Avenatti.[13] Bronfam's lawyer is Mark Geragos, who had recently been implicated in the Avenatti arrest on the Nike extortion charge, admitted that he had been in contact with Avenatti about joining the case. The stress caused Bronfam to faint and carried out of the courtroom in a stretcher. The judge then ordered court to reconvene as he grilled the defense on the lawyers involved in the case. After she returned to court, Bronfam admitted to briefly retaining Avenatti before hiring Geragos after finding him online.[14] Stormy Daniels Fraud Charges On May 22nd, 2019, Avenatti was charged with using a doctored document to divert $300,000 due to Daniels from a book deal to himself to pay personal and business expenses.[19] On Twitter, Avenatti denied the charges, saying, \"No monies relating to Ms. Daniels were ever misappropriated or mishandled. She received millions of dollars worth of legal services and we spent huge sums in expenses. She directly paid only $100.00 for all that she received. I look forward to a jury hearing the evidence.\u201d Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman stated, \"Far from zealously representing his client, Avenatti, as alleged, instead engaged in outright deception and theft, victimizing rather than advocating for his client.\" When Avenatti was indicted on defrauding Nike, Daniels had stated she was \u201csaddened but not shocked\" and that she had fired Avenatti a month earlier after \u201cdiscovering that he had dealt with me extremely dishonestly.\u201d                    Search Interest                        External References  [1] MSNBC \u2013 Daniels Lawsuit [2] ThinkProgress \u2013 Stormy Daniels goes nuclear on Trump, reveals all in new lawsuit [3] Wall Street Journal \u2013 Trump Lawyer\u2019s Payment to Stormy Daniels Was Reported as Suspicious by Bank [4] LA Times \u2013 Trump meets his match: Stormy Daniels' combative lawyer Michael Avenatti [5] Time \u2013 Michael Avenatti's Past Won't Stop Him From Running in 2020 [6] CNN Michael Avenatti to Time: 2020 Democratic nominee 'better be a white male' [7] TMZ \u2013 Michael Avenatti Arrested for Felony Domestic Violence [8] Twitter \u2013 @MichaelAvenatti [9] CNN \u2013 Michael Avenatti charged with trying to extort more than $20 million from Nike [10] CNN \u2013 Charges against Michael Avenatti for trying to extort Nike [11] Twitter \u2013 JGolden5 [12] New York Times \u2013 Michael Avenatti Accused in Nike Extortion Attempt [13] Gothamist \u2013 Because The Nxivm Sex Cult Case Wasn't Wild Enough, Michael Avenatti Got Involved [14] New York Post \u2013 Clare Bronfman says she fired Avenatti, found Geragos instead online for Nxivm trial [15] ABC News \u2013 Feds to file new charges against Michael Avenatti [16] Twitter \u2013 BNONews [17] LA Times \u2013 Avenatti indicted on 36 charges of tax dodging, perjury, theft from clients [18] CBS \u2013 Michael Avenatti Pleads Not Guilty To Embezzling Millions From Clients [19] AP News \u2013 Michael Avenatti charged with defrauding Stormy Daniels       Latest Editorial And News       How Standing On The Gravitron Became The Ultimate Meme Of Rebellion        TikToker Justine Paradise Accuses Jake Paul Of Sexual Assault        Legendary Rapper DMX Dies At 50        Maggie Goldenberger Auctioning Off Original \u2018Ermahgerd\u2019 Photo As Meme NFTs Continue Trending Online"}, "I'm Already Tracer": {"image": "https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/487/overwatchtiktok.jpg", "type": ["Parody", "Song", "Viral Video"], "origin_year": "2018", "date_added": "2018-10-26T12:18:18-04:00", "views": 1012965, "videos": 20, "photos": 16, "comments": 71, "about": "\"I'm Already Tracer\" is a memorable lyric from the song \"No Mercy\" by The Living Tombstone.

In 2012, he defeated congressman Silvestre Reyes in Texas' deeply-Democratic 16th district, and he became a member of the United States House of Representatives, where he currently still serves. Political Views O'Rourke is a member of the New Democrat Coalition, which is described as moderate or centrist, but is also considered to have progressive and liberal views. He is considered by GovTrack to be in the center of House Democrats, left of some and right of others. He supports efforts to combat global warming, stronger antitrust laws, decriminalization of cannabis, single-payer healthcare, marriage equality, and pro-choice stances. He supported the Take a Knee protests and has spoken out against racial inequality. Senate Race Against Ted Cruz O'Rourke ran for Senator of Texas against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz and lost. He was considered a long-shot candidate, as Texas has not has a Democratic senator since 1994. He has not received PAC money and instead has funded his candidacy through small donations. He significantly out-raised Ted Cruz in the race . O'Rourke polled closer than expected, but was still behind Cruz in most polls come election day. It is speculated that with the national attention to his campaign, O'Rourke could be a could candidate for President in the 2020 election, and O'Rourke has drawn comparisons to Barack Obama. Concession Speech During O'Rourke's concession speech, he surprised cable news outlets by telling his supporters and staff \"I'm so fucking proud of you guys.\"  The moment was celebrated by Twitter users who saw it as a moment of attractive authenticity. Twitter user @Celina_Curry tweeted of the moment, saying \"We're married now\" (shown below, left).

I am running to serve you as the next president. The challenges we face are the greatest in living memory. No one person can meet them on their own. Only this country can do that, and only if we build a movement that includes all of us.

O'Rourke has been described as a candidate with positions akin to Barack Obama, which CNBC[9] described as putting him in the \"middle\" of the crowded field. Donald Trump mocked Beto by making fun of his hand gesticulations, pondering \"maybe he's crazy.\"[10] Online, the news was met with criticism from progressives who were unenthusiastic about O'Rourke's positions and candidacy. Paste[11] called O'Rourke the \"Candidate For Vapid Morons,\" comparing his charm to Obama's charismatic 2008 run and Obama's subsequent centrist presidency. Slate[12] wrote that O'Rourke lacked a single reason to run for President, though he already had much of the star-power needed to mount a serious challenge. On Twitter, user @AdamJohnson tweeted that Beto's candidacy seemed more well-suited to America in 2003, but years of \"vapid centrism\" had (eaten) away (the democratic base's) pensions and wages and gave us two decades of perma-war\" (shown below, left). Twitter user Luke Savage joked \"The Beto O'Rourke presidential campaign is fanfiction for people who wear lanyards to sleep and think the West Wing was a documentary\" (shown below, right).     On the positive side, O'Rourke received an endorsement from Maryland governor Martin O'Malley[13] and congressional candidate Stephanie Murphy.[14] On March 18th, the O'Rourke campaign announced that they had raised $6.1 million on the first day of his campaign,[16] the most raised by a Democratic candidate thus far, topping Bernie Sanders' $5.9 million.[16]                    Online Presence O'Rourke has 660,000 likes on Facebook[2] and 700,000 Twitter followers.[3] The Onion[4] posted a parody article saying Ted Cruz released an attack ad calling Beto \"Too Good for Texas\" (shown below). The San Antonio Current[5] posted a slideshow of O'Rourke memes making the politician appear dreamy.    #Beto2020 After O'Rourke's loss to Cruz, many people on Twitter began speculating about O'Rourke running for president in 2020, sharing their thoughts with the hashtag #Beto2020. The hashtag was covered by The Hill,[7] who pointed to celebrities who tweeted the hashtag including Olivia Wilde and Alyssa Milano.     Notable Endorsements Jake Gyllenhaal On November 4th, actor Jake Gyllenhaal posted a photograph on Facebook [5] of himself in a Beto O'Rourke for Senate t-shirt with a caption that encouraged people to vote Democratic candidates. The post received more than 20,000 reactions, 1,200 comments and 5,900 shares in two days (shown below).    Conservative fans of Gyllenhaal reacted negatively to the post, creating an outrage against his political beliefs. Much of this backlash began when the rightwing media company The Blaze tweeted[6] the photograph with the caption \"You don't live in Texas, Jake\" (shown below, left). Following the post, other retweeted the The Blaze and added their own commentary on why they no longer cared for Gyllenhaal (examples below, center and right).      Lebron James When playing a road game against the San Antonio Spurs, LeBron James arrived to the arena wearing a hat endorsing O'Rourke. This was covered by national publications[6] who noted it was not the first time LeBron had praised O'Rourke, having previously supported his stance on #TakeAKnee.    James later clarified on election night that he likes what Beto stands for (shown below).   LeBron on what he\u2019s learned about the importance of voting. At the end I asked if there were races besides Texas senate he was keeping an eye on. He said yes, didn\u2019t want to talk about what they were and then complimented \u2066@BetoORourke\u2069. pic.twitter.com/AZ5VXVmFSj \u2014 Tania Ganguli (@taniaganguli) November 6, 2018     Beyonc\u00e9 On November 6th, 2018, the day of the midterm elections, Beyonc\u00e9 endorsed Beto O'Rourke on her Instagram page.

A post shared by  Beyonc\u00e9 (@beyonce) on Nov 6, 2018 at 2:08pm PST    Many felt the timing of the endorsement was too late to make an impact on the election. Political analyst David Corn said that the time to make such a post was any time before the day of the election (shown below, left). Twitter user @KimberlyNFoster joked that it was the first Beyonc\u00e9 surprise-drop that was poorly timed (shown below, right).     Some Twitter users went so far as to blame Beyonc\u00e9 for O'Rourke's loss. One particular tweet, since-deleted, driving the narrative was by @Cameron_Kasky (shown below).    This helped create the impression of a wave of people literally blaming Beyonc\u00e9 for O'Rourke's loss, and many more tweets pushing back against the idea appeared than people sincerely tweeting it. Responding to Kasky's tweet, user @pettyblackgirl gained over 620 retweets and 2,800 likes (shown below, left). User @spxncxrx also responded to Kasky's tweet, gaining over 60 retweets and 240 likes (shown below, right).     Dentist Instagram Story On January 10th, 2019, O'Rourke posted a story to his Instagram in which he visited his dentist and live from the chair interviewed her about her experience growing up near the border of Mexico. The story was part of an ongoing series in which O'Rourke speaks to people who grew up near the border to discuss their experiences amidst the ongoing government shut-down President Trump enforced until he receives monetary approval for a Wall across the American-Mexican border.    Twitter users had a wide variety of reactions to the spread of the story. User @menks101 posted an Office expressing their disgust (shown below, left). User @jaredholt posted an #UpgradeChallenge meme comparing the social media skills of O'Rourke to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, gaining over 300 retweets and 1,900 likes (shown below, right).

User @Neighbormania sarcastically tweeted \"Definitely don't want to vote for this cool guy who did fun stuff and had friends,\" gaining over 380 retweets and 10,000 likes (shown below, left). User iCyclone said that he was glad to see an elected official who's \"lived life\" as opposed to \"walking corpses in suits\" (shown below, right).

Involving loads of drama and memes, ModMurder (or MD, as many members of the community refer to it as), has gone through numerous moderator and format changes, yet has stayed true to its original concept.\nFormat\nMD was designed as a month-long competition with 30 contestants (the number varies from season to season, as does the inclusion and type of teams) with daily eliminations based on a community vote. At the beginning of each season, a post is created with a bot command (eg: become-a-contestant) to enter the contestant drawing, and after a few days, a bot will randomly choose a set number of entrants to become a contestant mod for that season. Each day, the head administrator of the community (currently u/RPG_Ivan) releases a new challenge for the contestants to complete, as well as a poll to determine who will be eliminated. The challenges range from writing a fanfiction story about oneself to creating a sbubby-esque logo for ModMurder. In the end, the last contestant standing is awarded the position of permanent moderator, and usually helps out the other moderators with running the subreddit and Discord server, where most of the action takes place. \nPrevious seasons\nSeason 1, taking place in August of 2018, involved two teams, each with fifteen contestants.

The collection began with about 160 people but grew to more than 500.[1] Within a week, that number grew to about 5,000 migrants.  Developments Government Response Shortly after the caravan left San Pedro Sula, Vice President Mike Pence \"urged the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala to persuade their citizens to stay home.\"[2] He said, \"Tell your people: don\u2019t put your families at risk by taking the dangerous journey north to attempt to enter the United States illegally.\" President Trump denounced the caravan in a number of speeches, interviews and social media posts.

According to the Times, \"the massing of American troops comes as Mr. Trump has seized on the caravan as a closing political message in the final week before the midterms, warning darkly -- and without evidence -- that 'Middle Eastern' people are part of a dangerous mob of migrants threatening to surge into communities here.\" That day, DC Examiner editor Dave Brown tweeted[17] a video of troops leaving Fort Knox for the southern border.

Their debut album received mixed reviews from critics, receiving a score of 58 on Metacritic.[4] The New York Times[6] described the group as a novelty in the current era, saying their evocation of 70s classic rock was akin to them putting on a \"period costume.\" Pitchfork Review Popular indie-music review site Pitchfork[5] sparked controversy by giving the group a scathing 1.6/10 review. Critic and Pitchfork senior editor Jeremy D. Larson wrote of the band, \"Greta Van Fleet sound like they did weed exactly once, called the cops, and tried to record a Led Zeppelin album before they arrested themselves\" and described the band as being designed to be friendly towards classic rock algorithms in streaming services while having none of the authenticity of the bands they attempt to emulate. The review was praised for its ruthlessness and humor. User @redfabbri tweeted the first paragraph of the review, saying \"I am dead\" (shown below, left). User @timmarchman tweeted another paragraph, calling the whole review the best thing he'd read that day (shown below, right).     Others defended the band against the review.

You\u2019ll see him two or three times, each for a few seconds, but if you pause on him you will also see something profound.

When I pulled out my phone to document what happened and exactly what he\u2019d said to me (AND how he\u2019d said it!) he turned his back and walked away from me. When I followed him and demanded that he answer my question, he ran to the back of the store and slammed a door in my face.

Georgia Voting Purge In early October 2018, investigative journalist Greg Palast warned Georgian voters to check if they were still registered. Last year.[24] Last year, Republican gubernatorial candidate and current Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp incorrectly canceled some 340,000 voter registrations, falsely asserting they had moved out of the state, according to a recent investigation by Palast.[25][26] Later on, Greg Palast created a website for those to make sure they were registered.[27] In later October, leaked audio was found with Brian Kemp expressing concern over people exercising their right to vote: \u201cThey have just an unprecedented number of that,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is something that continues to concern us, especially if everybody uses and exercises their right to vote -- which they absolutely can -- and mail those ballots in, we gotta have heavy turnout to offset that.\u201d White Supremacist Robocalls In late October and early November, robocalls were sent out by a white supremacist group targeting specific non-white candidates, including Florida's Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum and Georgia gubernatorial candidate [29][30].    Election Day Voting Issues On November 6th, voters from numerous states reported a variety of issues with voting, including \"broken machines, rejected ballots and untrained poll workers improperly challenging Americans\u2019 right to vote.\" In Georgia and New York, voters reported issues with machines, which led to longer wait times, while voting-rights organizations fielded more than 10,000 calls by 11:30 a.m.[13] Celebrity Votes On November 6th, Twitter[9] compiled a Moments page, documenting the many celebrities that voted and posted about it on Twitter. Former United States First Lady Michelle Obama tweeted,[10] \"#ElectionDay is here! It\u2019s time to vote--get to the polls and make sure every single person you talk to today is doing the same.

Results In the Senate, Republicans held the chamber of Congress, picking up several Senate seats in contentious states, including Missouri and North Dakota, reaching the necessary 51 seat majority. However, the Democratic party retook the House of Representatives, ending the night with 220 seats. As a result of the win, the Democrats gained more investigative power, allowing them to subpoena the president and his staff. However, by keeping the Senate, Republicans will be able to continue to confirm judges unabated.    Some races, however, were too close to call by the end of the night. With 100% of the reporting in, the Florida Senate race between Rick Scott\u00ae and incumbent Bill Nelson (D) will be decided in a recount because the results were within a 0.5% margin.[15] Additionally, the contentious Georgia Governor's race between Brian Kemp and Stacy Abrams will likely go into a run-off election, asking voters to return to the polls in December 2018.[16] Abrams states that she is determined to make sure every vote is counted, and her campaign manager confirmed that \"there are tens of thousands of absentee ballots around the state, many of them we believe are Abrams voters.\" Historical Victories The 2018 Midterms saw a record-breaking number of women being elected to the House.

In 2014, a PC rerelease of the game topped Steam sales the day of release. The game won several awards from publications, including Best Artistic Graphics from Gamespot, Best Original Soundtrack from GameSpy, was acknowledged by the Guinness Book of World Records as the Best Strategy Game for the Playstation 3 in 2010. It was also notably reviewed by Zero Punctuation in one of the series' earliest reviews (shown below).  The following two games in the main series were released on the Playstation Portable (PSP). Valkyria Chronicles III was not released outside of Japan.     Valkyria Chronicles 4 was released in Japan for the Playstation 4 in March of 2018[3] and worldwide for the XboxOne, Nintendo Switch, and Microsoft Windows in September of the same year. The game again scored well on Metacritic, with scores of 81, 84, and 85 on the Switch, PC and PS4 respectively.  Anime After a manga was made of the first game, an anime series based on the first game helped bring attention and sales to the series. It premiered on April 4th, 2009, directed by Yasutaka Yamamoto, and was produced by Aniplex's A-1 Pictures. The anime took some liberties with the original game, generally following the plot but changing some characters' personalities and adding others.                     Online Presence The series boasts a decent online presence, with over 6,800 fans on Facebook[4] and a subreddit with over 3,200 followers.[5]                    Search Interest     External References  [1] Wikipedia \u2013 Valkyria Chronicles [2] Metacritic \u2013 Valkyria Chronicles [3] Wikipedia \u2013 Valyria Chronicles 4 [4] Facebook \u2013 Valkyria Chronicles [5] Reddit \u2013 /r/valkyria       Latest Editorial And News       How Standing On The Gravitron Became The Ultimate Meme Of Rebellion        TikToker Justine Paradise Accuses Jake Paul Of Sexual Assault        Legendary Rapper DMX Dies At 50        Maggie Goldenberger Auctioning Off Original \u2018Ermahgerd\u2019 Photo As Meme NFTs Continue Trending Online"}, "Register to Vote Roll": {"image": "https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/406/roll.jpg", "type": ["Social Game"], "origin_year": "2018", "date_added": "2018-10-17T14:19:11-04:00", "views": 8472, "videos": 0, "photos": 15, "comments": 18, "about": "Register to Vote Roll is a bait and switch prank in which a social media post advertises a viral or sensational news story, essentially clickbait, but the included link leads to a voter registration form.", "origin": "The earliest known usage of the prank was posted by Twitter user @AshleeMPreston on October 12th, 2018.

Reardon stated:  I was at The Minnesota State Fair\u2026. we were in the pig barn and I had noticed this guy was very clean for a pig (probably had just been washed for competition?) and had his butt facing us with gigantic balls.  My friends and I had just noticed him and were all looking at his gargantuan balls for no more than 3 seconds when all of a sudden he poops out this huge turd. It fell out his ass, onto his balls and sat on top of them for about 30 seconds before slowly sliding off. I think he made it fall off by taking a couple steps.  We were horrified and couldn't believe what we just saw. It was a very random and coincidental thing for us all to see. I just happened to have my phone out when it happened, felt compelled to document the nastiness, and there you have it. I sent it to Brandon and he posted it up on Reddit for the world to see.  The picture is disgusting but I still think it's hilarious. I had some lucky timing.  Additionally, Notopoulos inquired about the state of the pig's health, and swine physician Dr. Larry Rueff stated:  Actually the pig is healthy. The fact is the pig is an example of a typical male that is used for breeding. He is extremely lean (little fat) and heavily muscled. The fact that he is tilted a little to his left makes it look like his ribs are showing when actually it is just his skin rolled together.  He has just had a bowel movement and because he has large testicles it had a little difficulty falling to the ground. That would have worked it's self out in a few minutes. He is rather well developed but not unhealthy. In fact the sows(females) would consider him quite healthy!  The photo was also used to troll others on Twitter. For example, in 2016, in response to rude remarks made to user pattymo by user Stephen Lee (@steleeemancman), @pattymo encouraged his followers to send the image to Lee with the phrase \"Pizzagate is fake,\" which several did (shown below).     The photo also saw use in forum threads such as that for Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal fans as a means to make moderators lock what some considered bad threads. For example, the image appeared in a July 2016 thread complaining about the amount of homosexual couples in the comic, resulting in the thread being locked.[7]            Search Interest                External References  [1] Imgur \u2013 Ah poopballs!

The coincidence of the event and a variety rumors and obscure videos shared that day led to the premature conclusion that the platform was taken down on purpose to cover the leakage of compromising content. The most widespread theory involved the upload of alleged footage of a reptilian, either being captured or undergoing a transformation, which started trending minutes before the outage. One of the most shared clips showed distorted footage of a man\u2019s body covered in mud or feces, which got 20,000 views on Facebook (sample shown below, top left). One particular video shared under the name \"(Dreamer Heaven Level's) 1. Rain's Demise of Reptile\u201d (sample shown below, top right)[7] gained attention in later months due to its association with Worldcorp Enterprise and its probable origin being a snuff pedophilia site.[8][9] After the outage, obscure clips with a similar name continued being uploaded to the platform (shown below, bottom left) and social media, many of which, however, were bait-and-switch videos in disguise (example shown below, bottom right).       Another common theory was about an alleged leaked footage of a \"pedophilic ritual\" carried on by politicians and well-known personalities, reason for which \u201cthe FBI released an HIV cure as a smokescreen\".[10] A thread about blackmail tapes started on roughly one hour after at 10:20 p.m. EST, on 4chan\u2019s /x/ (paranormal) board (shown below, left)[11] was often referenced as proof by along a picture of unknown source portraying former US president Barack Obama wearing a silver robe, mask and horns (shown below, right).[12]     Other hypotheses involved unusual light sightings on the sky (shown below), leaked footage of objects hitting the moon and UFO sightings.[10][12]      After the event, many Spanish-speaking Youtubers reported on the event. For example, The next day, on October 17th, Youtuber gRUNgerOFICIAL uploaded a video reporting on the multiple theories and gained over 3 million views and 51,000 likes.[12] On the other hand, many users remained skeptic about them. Also on October 17th, Youtuber DrossRotzank mocked many of the rumors about the about outage during a livestream on the YouNow. After its reupload on Youtube the video gained over 1.3 million views and 76,000.[13]            Search Interest Search queries for both \"youtube outage\" and \"caida youtube\" spike during October 2018, with \"caida youtube\" showing more search interest to a small degree probably. This is probably due to interest on conspiracy theories in latinamerican countries since search interest for the term \"reptiliano\" almost doubling search interest on the outage itself in those regions.[14]                External References  [1] Reddit \u2013 /r/news [2] Twitter \u2013 @MKBHD's tweet [3] Reddit \u2013 /r/videos [4] Reddit \u2013 /r/youtube [5] Twitter \u2013 @ChrisRGun's tweet [6] Twitter \u2013 @TeamYouTube's tweet [7] Reddit \u2013 /r/MrDachshund99/ [8] Youtube \u2013 Investigating the Weird \"Dreamer Heaven\" Video\u2026 [9] Youtube \u2013 The \"Dreamer Heaven\" Incident: What We Know So Far [10] FayerWayer \u2013 Este es el video del reptiliano que, seg\u00fan Internet, provoc\u00f3 la ca\u00edda mundial de YouTube / 10-17-2018 [11] 4chan \u2013 /x/ thread 189700168 [12] Youtube \u2013 \u00bfVideo Filtrado de un Reptiliano REAL Provoc\u00f3 la Ca\u00edda de YouTube?

Provisions With the passing of the law, alongside allowing recreational marijuana and marijuana product use as of October 17th, this also included the following conditions:  \u2022 Individuals age 18 or 19, depending on the province or territory, and older will be allowed to use marijuana in places such as private homes. \u2022 People will be allowed to carry up to 30 grams on their person. \u2022 Up to four plants can be grown for personal use, except in Manitoba and Quebec. Edibles are allowed to be created and used for personal use, but not bought or sold until at least 2019. \u2022 Provinces control how they can distribute the drug, enforce the law, and can enact further control and restriction on sale, use, and possession if needed. Drug distribution in the territories will be completely handled by the government. \u2022 Legal sales will be provided through retail outlets or the postal service if bought online. Sales sent through mail will be handled by the federal government. \u2022 International travelers will not be allowed to carry marijuana onto their flight. Domestic travelers inside the country will be allowed to carry up to 30 grams in their luggage. \u2022 Despite legalization, marijuana possession remains a federal crime in the U.S. Thus, travelers heading to the U.S. who have had previous use of cannabis, or any substance prohibited by U.S. federal laws, could mean that entry could be denied. It remains to be seen as to whether or not this will result in a lifetime ban from the U.S. \u2022 Driving while high will result in fines, or in the most serious cases jail time, as it falls under driving under the influence. \u2022 Branding on marijuana products is allowed, alongside factual information, but must avoid anything that would appeal to youths, such as a celebrity endorsement. Promotion is only allowed in places where youths cannot see it.                     Development Reaction By and large, Canadians support legalization.

Founded by the World Federation for Mental Health, the day serves as global reminder of the importance of mental health and was celebrated in more than 150 countries.[1][2] According to the WFMH: \"The Day had no specific theme. Its aims were general ones of promoting mental health advocacy and educating the public on relevant issues. In the first three years one of the central activities to mark the Day was a two-hour telecast broadcast globally through the US information agency satellite system from studios in Tallahassee, Florida. WFMH Board members participated from the studio, with live telephone participation from Australia, Chile, England and Zambia and pre-taped segments from Geneva, Atlanta and Mexico City. In the first such telecast we realized that we were indeed reaching far afield, because there was an unanticipated and unscheduled telephone call-in from Swaziland, where a group of WFMH members had gathered to view to the program.

In 2018, the duo released their fifth studio album Trench. The album was preceded by the release of the singles \"Jumpsuit\" and \"Nico and the Niners\".                        Reputation Both Blurryface and Trench received positive reviews from critics, receiving scores of 80 and 81 on Metacritic,[2] respectively. Critics praised the depth of the band especially against the context of most radio pop music. Music critic Anthony Fantano, while not impressed with their album Blurryface, giving it a  \"light-to-decent 4\", later gave Trench a \"decent-to-strong 8\" in his YouTube reviews for the two albums (shown below).

A manga adaptation of the series made by Megumu Soramichi and published by Cycomics began publication on October 8, 2018.[1]  The series follows Franchouchou, an all-zombie idol group composed of members originally alive at various points in modern japanese history. The members were assembled by necromancer and manager K\u014dtar\u014d Tatsumi, with the aim of saving the fading relevance of Saga prefecture by putting it on the map with the group's popularity. The story is told mostly from the perspective of Sakura Minamoto, a high school girl who died on her way to an idol audition in 2008. The series is cast on Crunchyroll and simuldubbed by Funimation.[2] The first episode debuted on October 4th, 2018.                    Online Presence The series has a MyAnimeList[3] page, where it has a rating of 7.38, as well as a TV Tropes[4] page. A Reddit thread on /r/anime[5] about the first episode gained over 2,000 points. A thread on /r/animegifs[6] joked about how Minamoto was killed by Truck-kun, gaining over 80 points.    Rap battle On October 11, 2018, the second episode of Zombie Land Saga aired. Towards the end of the episode, rising tension between Sakura Minamoto and her fellow group member Saki Nikaidou culminates in a rap battle between the two. The scene was uploaded to YouTube by Crunchyroll Deutschland[7], receiving over 920k views as of December 24, 2018.    The scene stood out among fans, with various edits being made of it.

Crunchyroll Subbing Controversy On November 22, 2018, the eighth episode of Zombie Land Saga was broadcast; in the episode, it is revealed that the character Lily Hoshikawa is a trans girl originally named Masao G\u014d before she died.[11] Following the release of the episode on Crunchyroll, several Internet users claimed that the episode's subtitles may have been changed in order to push a pro-LGBT message which was not present in the original, as well as that the character was a trap rather than truly transgender. This claim spurred a movement in support of the character, including posts by the show's official English social media accounts.[12] The claims have since been disproved by fans comparing the original japanese audio to the Crunchyroll subtitles, revealing that no specific details were fabricated by the translation, as well as by comments from the series' staff.[13][14]                    Search Interest                        External References  [1] \u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30df Cycomics \u2013 \u30be\u30f3\u30d3\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30b5\u30ac [2] Wikipedia \u2013 Zombie Land Saga [3] MyAnimeList \u2013 Zombieland Saga [4] TV Tropes \u2013 Zombie Land Saga [5] Reddit \u2013 /r/anime [6] Reddit \u2013 /r/animegifs [7] YouTube \u2013 Crunchyroll Deutschland [8] Reddit \u2013 /r/animemes [9] YouTube \u2013 Kurosai [10] YouTube \u2013 Triple-Q [11] Anime News Network \u2013 Episode 8 \u2013 Zombie Land Saga [12] Twitter \u2013 @SagaZombieLand   [13] The Daily Dot \u2013 Twitter is falling in love with this anime\u2019s zombie trans girl [14] Blogspot \u2013 Andrea Ritsu \u2013 No, Crunchyroll Did Not Conjure Up A Trans Girl In Their Subs For Zombie Land Saga.

YouTube Advertising Controversy On September 26th, 2018, amidst a wave of YouTube content creators discussing their mental health issues and \"burnout\" in videos on their channel,[2] channel Memology101 posted a video showing that many of the popular accounts making videos discussing their mental health such as Elle Mills and Boogie2988 were sponsored by BetterHelp, arguing that these channels were exploiting mental health issues and perhaps faking them while promoting a mental health service (shown below, top left). This became a multi-part series (other videos shown below). These videos also went into reviews from customers explaining their negative experiences with BetterHelp, how YouTube creators promoting BetterHelp created a \"circle of promotion,\" and the way these YouTubers potentially misrepresented the application.       The negative reviews about BetterHelp focused on how the app did not provide the service it promised. Some negative reviews taken from Polygon's[3] explainer on the controversy illustrate how the site made them pay more than what was advertised and saw counselors not offering guidance or canceling/no-showing appointments. Additionally, Polygon pointed out that BetterHelp's term's of service did not guarantee that the services provided were not quality-controlled and that it is the responsibility of the customer to verify the qualifications of their counselor.  We do not control the quality of the Counselor Services and we do not determine whether any Counselor is qualified to provide any specific service as well as whether a Counselor is categorized correctly or matched correctly to you\u2026 While we may try to do so from time to time, in our sole discretion, you acknowledge that we do not represent to verify, and do not guarantee the verification of, the skills, degrees, qualifications, licensure, certification, credentials, competence or background of any Counselor, It is your responsibility to conduct independent verification regarding any Counselor that provides you with Counselor Services (whether through the Platform or not) and we strongly recommend that you will conduct this verification prior to communicating with any Counselor through the Platform and on a continuous basis as you use the Platform.  One of the most popular creators sponsored by the service, Philip DeFranco, took to Twitter to say that he will be putting his ads from them on a \"temporary hold\" until BetterHelp \"rewords\" its terms of service.[4] Alon Matis took to Reddit[5] to defend the app, stating:  I don't have any response to the video because it's plainly bizarre. You are welcomed to go to our provider directory (www.betterhelp.com/counselors) and see the credentials and licensing information of each one of our providers. If you find a single counselor who is currently active on the platform but isn't a qualified professional, I will personally donate $500 to a charity of your choice.

Every Day I'm Shufflin' Every Day I'm Shufflin' is a catchphrase based on a line from \"Party Rock Anthem.\" The phrase has inspired the snowclone the \"Everyday I'm X'in\", which has frequently been used in image macro captions and animated GIFs. Remixes and parodies of the music video have been prevalent online since its YouTube debut in March of 2011. The \"Party Rock\" shuffle is a loose interpretation of the Melbourne Shuffle, a rave and club dance that originated in the late 1980s in the underground rave music scene in Melbourne, Australia. The basic movements in the Shuffle consist of a fast heel-and-toe action with hand movements suitable for various types of electronic music. Following the launch of the music video in March 2011, LMFAO introduced a line of t-shirts with the slogan \"Everyday I'm Shufflin.\" On April 15th, 2011, the first YTMND site titled \"Everyday I'm Shufflin\" was created, which featured a GIF from the 60s Spider-Man animated series.

In 2007, the US Government eliminated paper FAFSA forms save for special request orders. In 2017, the FAFSA form was first made available on October 1st (it had been up until then available on January 1st). The change was made to coincide with typical college application times. The deadline is the end of June the following year. FAFSA applicants submit their financial and geographical backgrounds, and may submit the application to up to ten schools. Students then receive a Student Aid Report informing them of what sorts of financial aid they are eligible for.                    Developments \"I'm Poor\" Tweet On June 24th, 2014, the Twitter account for FAFSA tweeted a reminder about the form using a GIF of Kristen Wiig from the film Bridesmaids saying \"Help Me, I'm Poor.\" The account paired the GIF with a caption reading \"If this is you, then you better fill out your FAFSA form\" (shown below).

For example, the Let's Play vash12349 uploaded a playthrough of the video game Until Dawn under the name \"Spooktober\" in 2015 (shown below, left). That same year, YouTube channel SmellyBellyTV gained over 3 million views with a Halloween-themed video of their family (shown below, right).

On April 21st, 2018, a post on womensweb.in[2] criticized the campaign for encouraging the silencing of women rather than having them speak out. Christianity Every Day[3] criticized the movement from the opposite perspective, claiming its feminism is \"against what the Bible teaches is right.\" The campaign drew the most attention when it circulated in September of 2018 for a September 30th, 2018 \"Blackout Day.\" Democrat and Chronicle[4] quoted women both for and against the blackout; one woman praised it as reflective of \"the power of women connecting by forming this virtual chain\u2026 This blackout and our being intentionally invisible for one day, speaks volumes about women\u2019s continuing challenge that we be taken seriously, and treated with dignity in all circumstances.\" The piece also quoted another woman who said, \"I will not participate in passive acts of \u201csolidarity\u201d that only harm us more in the long run. Why am I going to remove myself from a global platform when that\u2019s exactly what the patriarchy has been trying to do to us for centuries?!\" Jezebel[5] wrote a piece connecting the movement to the recent discussions about the role of alcohol in the sexual assault claims made against Brett Kavanaugh, writing, \"The same effort has been made at least once before, but this blackout happens to dovetail with a conversation about the link between blackout drinking and violence toward women, prompted by allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.\" A Forbes[6] contributor criticized the movement as \"spam\" with no actual political call to action behind it, and also criticized it for its terrible \"optics\" in asking women, particularly black women, to silence themselves with a black profile picture.

Reception Catherine was met with a mostly positive reception from critics, aggregating a weighted score of 82 and 79 out of 100 on Metacritic for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3[12] respectively. The game was praised for its story and gameplay, although early criticism was made towards the game's harsh difficulty. The game received numerous awards, including \"Best PS3 Story\" from IGN,[1] along with a nomination for \"PS3 Game of the Year.\" The game would also receive multiple nominations in GameSpot's 2011 Game of the Year awards, including \"Best Puzzle Game.\"[2] IGN would go on to list Catherine in their list of \"Top 25 PlayStation 3 Games\" in 2012[3] and 2013.[4]            Fandom Catherine sports a dedicated subreddit[5] and gaming wiki.[6] On February 1, 2012, a TVTropes page was created for Catherine.[13] Catherine also has a budding competitive scene through its local versus multiplayer mode that is unlocked after beating the game. There is often debate amongst competitive gaming enthusiasts on whether to classify the competitive gameplay of Catherine as a \"fighting game,\" despite the game mode not being designed as one.                Related Memes Catherine Box Art Parodies Catherine Box Art Parodies are a series of images and fanart that parody the box arts of the game Catherine, utilizing characters from other popular media replacing the characters on the box art.      Save Steve Delhomme    Steve Delhomme is a character in the game that previously had an affair with Catherine. Among the other sheep NPCs in the game, he is defined by his signature necktie. Fans of Catherine often fantasize a way to save Steve from his doom to the point of creating a petition[7] to Atlus to have a way to save him in Catherine: Full Body. There is a dedicated fan page of Steve Delhomme on Facebook, where fans wish there was a way to save him from his fate in the game.[8] Transgender Controversy On December 22nd, 2017, Atlus released a trailer for Catherine: Fullbody which has received 1,320,376 views and 11,000 likes in a year (shown below).  After viewing the trailer, fans speculated Rin to be transgender. This sparked controversy online as Atlus' past treatment of LGBTQ characters has been met with backlash.[9] The new controversy was covered in gaming journalism outlets, like Polygon[10] and Kotaku Australia.[11] Some fans have dubbed Rin as Traptherine due to speculation of her transgender depiction. On February 14th, Catherine: Fullbody was released in Japan. The western release is set for September 2019.[6] The next day, spoilers were released regarding the game's ending in which the trans character Erica does not transition, leading to ResetEra[16] user HylianSeven to post a thread titled \"[Major Spoilers] One of the endings in Catherine: Full Body gets extremely transphobic\u2026 moreso than that original.\" Many Twitter users responded by denouncing the Atlus (shown below).[17][18]     On February 16th, Twitter user @Proleptigram tweeted that the controversy took \"the ending out of context\" and that \"there are no lines about trying to improve Erica's life by not having her transition\" (shown below).

Six days later, Twitter user @ayyk92 posted a comic Bowser undergoing a similar transition (shown below, right), leading to a surge of Super Crown fan art drawings of that character as well as other Nintendo characters.     One of the most popular characters after Bowser was King Boo. On September 24th, the hashtag \"\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c6\u30ec\u30b5\u59eb\" began spreading on Japanese Twitter, where users posted fan art of the character. On September 24th, 2018 Twitter user sameduma uploaded a gif of Luigi being chased by said character (shown below).                       Spread Fanart featuring Luigi's Mansion remained a common theme amongst other pieces, due to King Boo serving as the final boss in the games. Later that day, user @ninouchiirazu[1] posted art of the scene gaining over 24,000 retweets and 80,000 likes (shown below, left). Other popular edits from that day include a drawing by Sofraaaaa (shown below, middle) and another by mashiron1020 (shown below, right) that gained 117,000 and 70,000 likes, respectively.      Although eastern fans of the character quickly settled on naming her Princess King Bowser, western fans also started referring her as Booette and Boosette due to the Super Crown edits of Bowser being called Bowsette. The same day, two subreddits devoted to the character launched: /r/Booette,[2] which quickly gained over 7,900 subscribers; and /r/Boosette,[3] which gained over 2,200 subscribers (top edits shown below).     Fanart of the character also drew inspiration from the original Bowsette comic by ayyk92. Two of the earliest examples of this were created by Tumblr user Rakkuguy on September 24th, who drew a comic in which Luigi gains a similar idea to create King Boo into a \"Peachette\" version after seeing Mario and Bowsette together; of which a recolor (shown below, left) managed to gather over 21,000 notes over 4 days compared to the original with only 4,500 notes over a similar timespan. This in turn lead to further comic continuations by other artists (examples shown below, middle and right).      Peachyboo Another popular edit of a boo with under the effect of the Super Crown went by the name Peachyboo. The character was coined by Twitter artist MikeLLunsford on September 23rd, 2018 (shown below).     The conception of the character led fans to create fan art of his design and cosplay the character (shown below).

Formerly known as Youtube personality and comedian Filthy Frank, he garnered notoriety and fame under the alias with skits that employed off-color, surreal, and often offensive humor combined with overarching lore, resulting in millions of subscribers, alongside comedy rap music under the affiliated alias Pink Guy, before switching over to producing lo-fi and R&B music as Joji. Since Miller's switch, he has garnered larger fame with his association with record label 88rising, releasing his debut album BALLADS 1 with the label.           Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce Vinny Sexual Misconduct Allegations        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       History Filthy Frank On June 15th, 2008, Miller launched the DizastaMusic Youtube channel and uploaded his first video \"Lil Jon falls off a table\" a few days later, on June 19th (shown below, upper right). On this channel, alongside various skits featuring him and his friends as the \"Tempura Boyz\" (shown below, upper left), would be skits featuring characters such as Filthy Frank and Pink Guy, both of which would see their earliest public appearances on August 5th, 2011 and February 10th, 2012 respectively in the videos \"Filthy Shit\" and \"ME SINGING ADELE\".       On January 22nd, 2013, Miller started another channel, TVFilthyFrank, which would serve as the main channel for all future Filthy Frank skits and videos, collectively referred to as The Filthy Frank Show, as Miller feared the old DizastaMusic channel would eventually be taken down due to stricter Youtube guidelines. Since beginning on Youtube, Miller also introduced other characters, such as lycra people, the dark god/lord Chin-Chin whose eyes were shut closed and speaks only the phrase \"Ore wa ochinchin ga daisuki nandayo\", and other assorted characters such as the muscular Prometheus, the Japanese roommate Safari Man, and the salamander-human hybrid Salamander Man, alongside concepts such as different dimensions, the ever-omnipotent and omniscient peace^lords, and the use of chromosomes. (examples shown below)     Miller also started a sister channel, TooDamnFilthy, on July 1st, 2014, to upload secondary and complementary material such as behind-the-scenes and alternate content that might be too risque for the main channel. Throughout all 3 channels, Miller employs darker, self-deprecating, off-colour, and often, low-brow and offensive humour, with series ranging from the instructional Japanese 101 where he teaches dirty Japanese words, batsu games where a loser must consume an unappetizing meal or worse, and videos containing large amounts of lore regarding the Filthy Frank universe.       Harlem Shake The Harlem Shake is a viral trend and dance craze featuring a single person dancing to the first few seconds of the song \"Harlem Shake\" by trap producer Baauer before being joined by a larger group of people dancing wildly to the song. The craze, started by Filthy Frank, originates from a video uploaded to DizastaMusic uploaded originally on January 20th, 2013, titled \"DO THE HARLEM SHAKE\" before being re-uploaded on February 3rd, 2013 (shown below). The video, featuring Miller and his friends dressed in lycra suits dancing in a crazy manner in the latter half of the video, served as the impetus of the viral craze and derivative works, alongside bringing Baauer to viral success with Harlem Shake becoming a number 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 after the charts began integrating YouTube plays and views for the first time in the chart's history. As of 2018, the video has accumulated over 60 million views.  Retirement of Filthy Frank On December 29th, 2017, two days after the publishing of his book on the Filthy Frank universe titled Francis of the Filth, Miller made the announcement on the official Filthy Frank Twitter account that he was done with comedic videos, owing to his lack of enjoyment in making them and the damage that the various voices posed to his health (shown below). He also pointed to neurological conditions he did not discuss.    In the statement, Miller refers to an interview he gave with Billboard in which he discussed moving on from the crude humor of his Filthy Frank videos to focusing on his music career as Joji, a lo-fi \"trap-n-B\" artist, as Billboard describes him. Pink Guy Alongside using Filthy Frank as an outlet for comedy, he has also used it as an outlet for comedic rap and hip-hop,  usually under the name Pink Guy. Under this alias, he has released 2 mixtapes and a remix EP, starting with his debut self-titled mixtape on May 23rd, 2014 as a free download. Consisting of various songs put out through the Filthy Frank channels, alongside skits and the like and employing the same type of raunchy and offensive humour as seen throughout the videos on the channel, within 4 years of uploading a small part of the full mixtape, the upload garnered over 11 million views. (shown below, left)     On January 4th, 2017, Miller released his first commercial mixtape/album Pink Season also under Pink Guy. Featuring production from collaborators such as josh pan, ryanjacob, Misogi, and Holder, formerly known as MajorLeagueWobs, alongside with Miller describing the upcoming release as \"making the first mixtape sound more like Kidz Bop,\" within a year of uploading the full mixtape to Youtube, the release has garnered over 7.4 million views as of writing. (shown above, right) On May 24th, Miller released an EDM remix EP of 4 songs titled Pink Season: The Prophecy, through record label 88rising. The EP consists of remixes from producers Borgore, Getter, TastyTreat, and Axel Boy, of the songs \"Dumplings\", \"Fried Noodles\", \"STFU\", and \"Are You Serious,\" respectively. A mixed version was released alongside the EP. (shown below)  On December 29th, Miller announced that he would be retiring from his comedy persona and work as Filthy Frank to focus on his more serious music project Joji and to focus more on his physical and mental well-being and health, as in a previous reveal video from years prior he suffered from seizures brought on by stress. This is also assumed to include his music as Pink Guy. Joji Under his Joji alias, he produces what could be described as under the genres of lo-fi, R&B and trip hop, similar to that of the late hip-hop producer Nujabes, with elements of folk. One example of a notable track from Joji would be \"Medicine,\" or \"medicine beat,\" a lo-fi hip-hop remix of the song \"Medicine\" by English folk band Daughter.  Joji in Filthy Frank In May 2014, after revealing himself to the world, Miller, in a video where he alternates between his actual self and his personas Filthy Frank and Pink Guy, makes announcements regarding upcoming content for the channel. One such announcement made in this video also included the fact that a \"serious music\" album under the name of Joji was in progress. alongside another Pink Guy album. However the albums were shelved. In its place, he released music as PinkOmega, described as a more serious alternative to Pink Guy, with tracks such as \"Dumplings\" and \"Wefllagn.ii \uff15\", later released as part of the Pink Season album, as \"Dumplings\" and \"We Fall Again.\" A reference to people wanting Miller to make serious music again can be seen in the track \"Rice Balls\", with the lyric \"Uh, we want real music, We want real music, we want Joji music.\" Chloe Burbank In late 2015, a Soundcloud account under the name of Chloe Burbank was discovered by users on Reddit with two songs uploaded to the account: \"Thom\" and \"you suck charlie\". (shown below) Though initially speculated to be Joji, it was later confirmed by him through an Instagram post and after his identity was leaked. The two songs posted would later be revealed as part of a new commercial project titled Chloe Burbank: Volume 1. As time went on, songs such as \"old yeller\", \"plastic taste\" and \"unsaved info\" to collaborations such as \"Visa\" with ryanjacob, Indica, and Floyd, and \"BESIDJU\" with Shamana would be uploaded or reposted to the account.     88rising In 2016, Miller signed with record label and media company 88rising to start uploading his music to their channel. Starting with previously released tracks such as \"Thom\" and \"WORLD$TAR MONEY\", his first new track uploaded to their channel would be \"i don't wanna waste my time\" released on April 27th, 2017. Within a year since being uploaded, the official audio video for the song on Youtube has received over 16 million views. He would also release the track \"rain on me.\" after the upload of \"i don't wanna waste my time\".     On October 18th, 2017, 88rising uploaded a new music video for the song \"will he\" by Joji. Within a little under a year, the music video garnered over 29 million views as of writing. 88rising would later upload a teaser showcasing a new project by Joji to be released through them. Titled In Tongues, the project, revealed to be Joji's debut EP, would be his first ever release on a label, including releasing with a major record. 88rising would also upload music videos for \"Demons\" and \"Window\" as part of promotion for this EP. On February 14th, 2018, a deluxe version of the album would be released, featuring 2 previously released tracks and remixes from artists such as Medasin, SwuM, and Lunice.     BALLADS 1 On September 12th, 2016, Joji released the song \"Slow Dancing in the Dark,\" as the lead single off of his debut album as Joji BALLADS 1. In the following 2 weeks since its release, the music video (shown below), uploaded by 88rising, has garnered over 12 million views. The music video follows the release of his previous single, \"Yeah Right.\" On October 2nd, Joji released the next single from the album \"Can't Get Over You\" featuring hip-hop producer Clams Casino. The release was also accompanied by a tracklisting, showing 12 tracks and other features from rapper Trippie Redd, and producers D33J and Shlohmo,                        Reputation Since his reveal as George Miller in May 2014, many people were amazed at how what many considered a shy and soft-spoken person could initiate such a raunchy trend in the form of various characters. Miller has also seen praise for the universe, characters, and world-building during the days of Filthy Frank.

Since the concept is based around a quiz, it allows for a wide range of topics, from gaming references to political and historical memes, and racial stereotypes.

According to internet blog posts from early 2007, the service was sporadically maintained by Google until July that year. On August 5th, 2008, Google released Insights for Search, an advanced search analytics service that visualizes the popularity of a search term by regional interest, as well as a leaderboard displaying most searched terms and rising search term. On September 27th, 2012, Google Insights for Search was merged into Google Trends. On May 22nd, 2013, Google unveiled a revamped version of the service with more in-depth features, including Hot Searches, a daily trend chart listing each day's most searched keywords, and Top Charts, a hub page that provided at-a-glance view of top 10 most searched keywords in 40 different categories spanning across TV entertainment, cinema, music, sports, education, business and brands.                    Features  Google Trends helps researchers understand keyword trends. When they enter up to five search terms at a time, Google Trends will then respond with a graph showing how popular each term is. The site also features seasonal trends graphs, regional trends and  related trends. Google will also display the trends according to their prevalence. Researchers can enter a search term to see where it ranks in overall searches.   Google also categorizes keywords according to how quickly they grow. Researchers can enter a search term and Google will present a graph showing how much growth, in percentages, it achieved during the time period selected. If the search term has recently exploded in popularity, Google will suggest that it is a \u201cbreakout\u201d keyword.   Google will automatically show a global search history when a user enters a search term into Google Trends. Hot searches keep users up to date with what people in a certain geographic area are searching for with a rough estimate of the number of searches the subject received.   Since 2012, Google Trends has released an annual report of the top ranked keywords and keyphrases that people looked up on Google\u2019s search engine. These lists can be viewed through global filters or by country. The lists include top searches in general as well as the top searches for people, athletes, news electronics and YouTube videos.  Search Data Google Trends data is an unbiased sample of Google search data. Realtime data is a random sample of searches from the last 7 days while non-realtime data is a random sample of Google search data that can be pulled from as far back as 2004 and up to 36 hours before a search. After search data is collected, Google Trends categorize it, connect it to a topic, and remove any personal information. Trends excludes any searches made by very few people, repeated searches from the same person over a short period of time and queries with apostrophes and other special characters.[1]                    Highlights \"Meme\" vs. \"Jesus\" On October 25th, 2016, Norwegian developer Dominik Salonen tweeted a screenshot of a Google Trends chart illustrating how the volume of search queries for \"meme\" eclipsed that of \"jesus\" for the first time in August that year.

Melmetal On October 24, 2018, a new video was posted to the official Pokemon Youtube channel (shown below, left), showcasing the evolved form of Meltan after several of the creatures merged, named Melmetal. Making Meltan the first Mythical Pokemon known to evolve and, like it's pre-evolved form Meltan, also a Steel-type, it was originally foreshadowed in a previous trailer for Pokemon Let's Go, where its silhouette could be seen near the end. However, it was here that it was officially shown. Further details were revealed such as its unique Steel-type move \"Double Iron Bash\" and how it could be obtained.     After its reveal, many noted the creature's larger and bulkier build, compared to Meltan's smaller and more malleable form, sometimes using the term \"absolute unit\" to describe it. As of Pokemon Sword and Shield, the only way to obtain a Melmetal in the main games is to transfer one from Pokemon GO, as the app remains the only way to evolve Meltan.

The two characters were depicted as best friends who shared a bedroom in their apartment on 123 Sesame Street. Puppeteers and writers, Frank Oz and Jim Henson, created the characters which were said to be based on their own friendship with one another.[6] Although Bert and Ernie did not share a bed, viewers still held on to the possibility of an intimate relationship between the two. In 1994, former Sesame Workshop head, Gary Knell, said that Bert and Ernie \u201care not gay, they are not straight, they are puppets. They don\u2019t exist below the waist.\" [4] On June 27th, 2013, The New Yorker's cover featured an illustration of Bert and Ernie cuddling on the couch as they watched the Supreme Court overturn the Defense of Marriage Act (shown below).[3]    Many members of the gay community voiced their frustration with Sesame Workshop's refusal to acknowledge a sexual relationship between Bert and Ernie. Many argued that it would be beneficial to portray a same-sex couple on Sesame Street. In 2011, a petition on Change.org called on Sesame Workshop and PBS to allow the characters to get married.[7] On August 11th, Sesame Workshop replied with a statement on Facebook[8] stating: \u201cBert and Ernie are best friends. They were created to teach preschoolers that people can be good friends with those who are very different from themselves. Even though they are identified as male characters and possess many human traits and characteristics (as most Sesame Street Muppets do), they remain puppets, and do not have a sexual orientation.\u201d                    Developments On September 16th, 2018, Sesame Street writer Mark Saltzman, who began writing for the show fifteen years after the characters were introduced, revealed in an interview with Queerty[2] that Bert and Ernie were analogs for his own intimate relationship with film editor Arnold Glassman. \"And I always felt that without a huge agenda, when I was writing Bert & Ernie, they were [gay]. I didn\u2019t have any other way to contextualize them. The other thing was, more than one person referred to Arnie & I as 'Bert & Ernie.'\" On September 18th, the Sesame Workshop Twitter feed responded to the controversy by claiming that Bert and Ernie don't have a sexual orientation because they are puppets (seen below).[1] The tweet was subsequently deleted.    The same day the New York Times published statements from Saltzman. \u201cAs a writer, you just bring what you know into your work. Somehow, in the uproar, that turned into Bert and Ernie being gay,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a difference.\u201d The New York Times stated that \"while [Saltzman] believes that Sesame Street should include a gay couple in its programming, he said it should be done with human characters, not puppets.\"[9] On September 19th, some Twitter users responded negatively to Sesame Workshop's statement (shown below).  Deeply, sorely, unbelievably disappointing statement. Absolutely reprehensible, you should be ashamed. You had an opportunity to teach children an actual lesson about people \"different from themselves\" and you not only dropped the ball, you spiked it & flipped LGBT kids the bird. \u2014 Red Durkin (@RedIsDead) September 18, 2018   Meanwhile, Frank Oz posted several tweets in response to the backlash.[5]  When I wrote \u201cThey\u2019re not, of course\u201d, did you think I was saying something like, \"They\u2019re straight like everyone else.\u201d ?  What I was  actually saying was \u201cThey\u2019re not, of course. Jim and I never created them to be gay\u201d.  Just a misunderstanding.

This comic introduced the alter-ego Billy Baston as well as the catchphrase \"Shazam.\"[1]     The character was the most popular superhero of the 1940s. However, Fawcett ceased publishing Captain Marvel-related comics in 1953, due, in part, to a copyright infringement lawsuit by D.C.

History", "origin": "", "other_text": "Captain Marvel made his debut in Marvel Super-Heroes #12 in December 1967 (shown below, left). The following year, the character was given its own series in May 1968 (shown below, right). In the character's first incarnation, Mar-Vell, he was an extraterrestrial from a race of beings known as the Kree. On Earth, Mar-Vell acted as a spy and had superhuman powers, including flight and superhuman strength.[1]     Carol Danvers Carol Danvers, who would later become the modern Captain Marvel, first appeared in Marvel Super-Heroes #13 in March 1968. The character, originally a colleague of Mar-Vell, the first Captain Marvel, received her powers when her DNA fused with Mar-Vell's in an explosion.[2] In January 1977, Danvers received her own title: Ms. Marvel, written by George Conway. In 2012, Ms. Marvel assumed the role of Captain Marvel.    Film Adaptation in October 2014, Marvel announced that a Captain Marvel film featuring Carol Danvers would be the studio's first female-led superhero film. Three years later, it was announced that Brie Larson would be playing the character in the film.[3] On September 18th, 2018, the first trailer for the film was released.

She said, \"About a year ago, I started paying attention to what my press days looked like and the critics reviewing movies, and noticed it appeared to be overwhelmingly white male. So, I spoke to Dr. Stacy Smith at the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, who put together a study to confirm that. Moving forward, I decided to make sure my press days were more inclusive.\" Following the interview, visitors of Rotten Tomatoes noticed an uptick in negative reviews on the Captain Marvel page ahead of the film's release. On February 18th, Twitter [10] user @camethedawnxp tweeted a series of screenshots of the reviews of user reviews for Captain Marvel. They wrote, \".@RottenTomatoes Captain Marvel is not even released yet and a bunch of recently created accounts w/no profiles are already downvoting it & making alt-right/nazi/KKK arguments. Should really install some vetting process for audience ratings or this will not stop..ever.\" The tweet received more than 260 retweets and 500 likes in less than two weeks (shown below). Many of the reviews, which have since been removed argue about the \"politics\" of the film. For example, one poster writes, \"Identity politics in our movies. As a white male (you know the bad gender) I will pass as I'm probably a sexist racist bigot anyway.\"    On February 25th, in a blog post, Rotten Tomatoes[11] announced that they will be removing the \"Want To See\" score for upcoming movies. This \"Want To See\" score allowed users to post comments on movies prior to release before an \"Audience Rating\" could be tabulated. They wrote: As of February 25, we will no longer show the \u2018Want to See\u2019 percentage score for a movie during its pre-release period. Why you might ask?  We\u2019ve found that the \u2018Want to See\u2019 percentage score is often times confused with the \u2018Audience Score\u2019 percentage number.

They also announced that they would be \"disabling the comment function prior to a movie\u2019s release date\" due to \"an uptick in non-constructive input, sometimes bordering on trolling.\" Once the movie is released user ratings and comments would be restored.

The series, however, only featured Mike Nawrocki and Phil Vischer from the original cast. The show was replaced by the series VeggieTales in the City in 2017.[4] On July 1st, 2018, Vischer confirmed that the show had been canceled on Twitter (shown below).

Near the end of 2014, AliveSinceForever disbanded and rebranded as Brockhampton,[3] with more members being added, some also from KanyeToThe, and released their first single under the new moniker, \"Bet I,\" on January 27th, 2015 (shown below, left). This would be followed up a few months later with the single \"Hero\" released on June 15th (shown below, right). \"Bet I\" would later be removed in 2017 due to Abstract saying that the song wasn't an accurate representation of the band now[4], as would \"Hero.\"     On August 28th, the group released the track \"Dirt\" on Fool's Gold Records. A music video (shown below, upper left) was released after winning a contest held by VFiles Loud. This would be followed up with the group's first mixtape All-American Trash on March 24th, 2016 (shown below, upper right). A music video for the song \"Flip Mo\" (shown below, lower left) by member Merlyn Wood would be posted as part of promotion for the mixtape. On January 27th, 2017, the group released the song \"Cannon\" alongside an accompanying music video. (shown below, lower right)       Saturation Trilogy On May 6th, 2017, Brockhampton released the song \"Face,\" the first single off of the group's debut album Saturation. A music video was released the same day and featured the band members destroying a house (shown below, upper left). The music video received 4.5 million views within over one year. The album's release would be preceded by three other singles following \"Face\", those being \"Heat\", \"Gold\", and \"Star\". (music videos shown below, remaining corners) The album was eventually released on June 9th.       On July 5th, 2017, a month after the release of their debut album, Kevin Abstract announced the second installment and the group's sophomore album would come out next month.[6] On August 25th, 2017, the group released Saturation II. The lead single, \"Gummy\", was released on August 1st, with the music video (shown below, upper left) garnering over 5 million views in over a year, and was also followed by three other singles, with one released every week prior to the album, those being \"Swamp\", \"Junky\", and \"Sweet\". (music videos shown below).       On December 15th, 2017, the group's third album and the final part in the Saturation trilogy, Saturation III was released. Though touted as the \"last\" album from the group[7], it was later clarified that the statement was not literal and that they would most likely put out more music.[8] The album's release was preceded by the lead single \"Boogie\", released on December 12th (music video shown below, left). In the weeks after the release of Saturation III, one of the songs from the album, \"Zipper,\" garnered notoriety due to containing a shout out to Youtube music critic and reviewer Anthony Fantano, who gave coverage on the group's albums, with the lyric \"Head was clean, Tony Fantano.\" (music video shown below, right)     The reception to the Saturation Trilogy has been generally positive, with Pitchfork giving Saturation I, II, and III a 6.5[9], 7.2[10], and 7.5[11] out of 10 respectively. Music critic Anthony Fantano has also rated the trilogy highly, with a light 9 for Saturation I and decent 8's for II and III (reviews shown below), also all out of 10. On RateYourMusic,[12] ratings of 3.53, 3.73, and 3.77 out of 5 have been given for I, II, and III respectively.     Signing to RCA On March 30th, 2018, it was announced on Brockhampton's Twitter[13] and Kevin Abstract's Instagram[14] that the group had signed to RCA Records, a major record label and division of Sony Music. The record contract was reported by news outlets to be worth over $15 million for six albums within three years.[15] However, despite the major signing, Abstract has assured on both Instagram and Twitter that everything else regarding the band, music, and music videos will stay the same.

Singer-songwriter Rhett Owen, who was in a relationship with him, accused Vann of being \u201cemotionally manipulative and mentally abusive\", along with leveraging accusations of sexual relations with a minor and abusing women. Another woman under the Twitter handle @GIGlNOTHADID shared claims from other women who had relationships with Vann.[16][17] In response, Vann tweeted from his now-deleted Twitter account \"although my behavior has been selfish, childish, and unkind, I have never criminally harmed anyone or disrespected their boundaries.\" He had also denied the claims of relations with a minor or violating anyone's consent. (shown below)    On May 27th, Brockhampton responded to the claims, tweeting a picture stating that Ameer would no longer be in the group, apologizing to Ameer's victims, and that they were sorry for not speaking up sooner. The group would cancel the remaining dates of their US tour to regroup as a result.

In its place was the announcement of another album Puppy, to be released in summer 2018.[20] A teaser featuring actor and musician Jaden Smith was released on March 30, 2018 (shown below, left). However, that album was also delayed after the allegations of sexual abuse directed at former member Ameer Vann came to light.[21] That summer, the group instead released a trio of singles, \"1999 Wildfire\", \"1998 Truman\" and \"1997 Diana\" as part of their Beats 1 radio show Things We Lost in the Fire Radio. All three were singles off of another album, now shelved, called The Best Years of Our Lives. (example shown below, right)     On August 26th, the group announced their fourth album iridescence to be released in September.[22] On September 13th, a tracklist was posted to Twitter alongside the release date of September 21st, with the album being revealed to be part of a new trilogy called \"The Best Years of Our Lives.\"[27] On September 20th, the day before the release of iridescence, the group uploaded the music video for the song \"J'ouvert\" off the new album (shown below). The album received generally positive reviews upon release.

One week later, on July 9th, President Trump announced that he would nominating Kavanaugh for the open seat left vacant by Justice Kennedy.[1]  Developments Reaction to Nomination The nomination of Kavanaugh was largely split along party lines between democrats and republicans. The verified GOP Twitter account tweeted,[2] \"Praise is pouring in for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, @realDonaldTrump\u2019s nominee for #SCOTUS \u2b07\ufe0f Sen. Mike Lee: 'I know him to be a smart and fair judge, one of the most admired appellate judges in the country.'\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 600 retweets and 1,800 likes in three months. Others questioned Kavanaugh's beliefs, particularly about his opinion on whether or not presidents can be indicted for a crime, which Kavanaugh has argued against in the past. Some believed this could create a conflict because the Russia investigation, in which President Trump is involved, could be heard before the Supreme Court (shown below, center).[3] Some questioned whether Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court could threaten abortion rights. CNN Legal Analyst Renato Mariotti tweeted,[4] \"Remember the undocumented pregnant minor who was denied access to an abortion? Brett Kavanaugh was in the minority of judges who voted against giving her access to an abortion. He will vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.\" The tweet (shown below, right) received more than 12,000 retweets and 20,000 likes in three months.      I Don't Know Kavanaugh the Man On July 10th, 2018, the Washington Post published an article written by Julie O'Brien, a neighbor of Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.[5] O'Brien's daughter is classmates with one of Kavanaugh's. The article, titled \"I don\u2019t know Kavanaugh the judge. But Kavanaugh the carpool dad is one great guy\" is meant to be a glowing testament to Kavanaugh's moral character, qualifications as a judge aside. After the article was posted, many Twitter users mocked it for being irrelevant to the debate surrounding Trump's pick of Kavanaugh to replace retiring justice Anthony Kennedy. Twitter user @Annehelen pointed out it didn't matter how nice a Supreme Court nominee was in a car pool, gaining over 40 retweets and 300 likes (shown below, left). MSNBC pundit Chris Hayes stated \"I can't believe this got published,\" gaining over 1,200 retweets (shown below, right).     Confirmation Hearing On September 4th, 2018, the Senate Judiciary Committee held the first hearing for the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh.[6]  Zina Bash White Power Sign Controversy Zina Bash White Power Sign Controversy refers to an online controversy surrounding a conspiracy theory accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's staff member Zina Bash of making a \"white power\" hand gesture during his confirmation hearing in early September 2018. On September 4th, 2018, footage of Bash seated behind Kavanaugh at the hearing began circulating on Twitter, with some accusing her of intentionally making a \"white power\" gesture with her hand (shown below). In particular, tweets by surgeon Eugene Gu and veteran Keith R. Dumas gathered upwards of 13,400 and 17,300 retweets respectively within 24 hours.[5][6] Additionally, activist Amy Siskind tweeted \"Kavanaugh\u2019s assistant Zina Bash giving the white power sign right behind him during the hearing? This alone should be disqualify!\"[2] The tweet was subsequently deleted.     Sexual Misconduct Controversy On July 30th, 2018, Professor Christine Blasey Ford wrote a confidential letter to Senator Diane Feinstein accusing Kavanaugh of sexual assault when Ford and Kavanaugh were high school classmates.[7] The letter wrote: \"Kavanaugh physically pushed me into a bedroom as I was headed for a bathroom up a short stair well from the living room. They locked the door and played loud music precluding any successful attempt to yell for help.  Kavanaugh was on top of me while laughing with REDACTED, who periodically jumped onto Kavanaugh. They both laughed as Kavanaugh tried to disrobe me in their highly inebriated state. With Kavanaugh's hand over my mouth I feared he may inadvertently kill me. On September 14th, The New Yorker[8] published that the confidential letter had circulated throughout Washington and Senate Democrats had referred the complaint to the FBI. In the story, Kavanaugh denied the allegations. He said, \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\" That day, in a letter[9] to the Senate Judiciary Committee, more than 65 women defended Kavanaugh. It read, in part, \"We are women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for more than 35 years and knew him while he attended high school between 1979 and 1983. For the entire time we have known Brett Kavanaugh, he has behaved honorably and treated women with respect.\" On September 16th, Ford came forward as the writer of the letter in an interview with the Washington Post.[10]  That day, two republican senators joined democrats in urging the vote be delayed until the woman testified in court. Following the publication, Twitter user @JuddLegum tweeted,[11] \"1. Kavanaugh's accuser is now on the record: Her name is Christine Blasey Ford 2. Ford has offered a detailed account of sexual assault by Kavanaugh 3. Ford's account corroborated by therapists notes from 2012 4. Ford passed a polygraph test by former FBI agent.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 18,000 retweets and 49,000 likes in 24 hours. The announcement also slowed down the once-thought quick confirmation of Kavanaugh as republican senators began calling for delays as well. Republican Senator Susan Collins tweeted,[12] \"Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee.\" The tweet (shown below, right) received more than 6,500 retweets and 27,000 likes in 24 hours.     The following day, Ford's attorney Debra Katz went on CBS This Morning and announced that she her client would be willing to testify.  Ed Whelan's Kavanaugh Doppelg\u00e4nger Conspiracy Theory Following Ford's accusation, various members of the conservative media had asserted that perhaps Ford was mistaken. On September 18th, Kathleen Parker wrote for the Washington Post, \"Is there a Kavanaugh doppelg\u00e4nger?\"[14] On September 20th, 2018, Ed Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center think and a former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, tweeted an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory, asserting that Christine Blasey Ford had been assaulted not by Judge Kavanaugh, but another classmate who he says resembles Kavanaugh. In the post, he shared Google maps that detail the distances between the victim, alleged assailant and the witnesses homes in relation to the house where the crime allegedly took place. He also posted floor plans and photographs of the house and yearbook photographs of Kavanaugh and Whelan's suspect (tweets, shown below).[13]       The posts were widely criticized among people online, democrats and republicans. CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted,[15] \"A prominent DC conservative, trying to promote an alternate theory that someone else (and not Kavanaugh) may have sexually assaulted Professor Ford, named that person, showed photographs suggesting Ford confused the two and more. This is stunningly irresponsible.\" The tweet received more than 9,700 retweets and 41,000 likes in 24 hours (shown below).    The following day, Whelan retracted his statement and deleted his tweets. He wrote, \"I made an appalling and inexcusable mistake of judgment in posting the tweet thread in a way that identified Kavanaugh's Georgetown Prep classmate. I take full responsibility for that mistake, and I deeply apologize for it. I realize that does not undo the mistake.\" The tweet received more than 1,900 retweets, 5,000 likes and 9,000 comments.[16]    Dr. Ford's Testimony On September 27th, 2018, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In her opening statement, she described the alleged assault (video below).[21] She said:  \"When I got to the small gathering, people were drinking beer in a small living room on the first floor of the house. I drank one beer that evening. Brett and Mark were visibly drunk. Early in the evening, I went up a narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the bathroom. When I got to the top of the stairs, I was pushed from behind into a bedroom. I couldn't see who pushed me. Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them. There was music already playing in the bedroom. It was turned up louder by either Brett or Mark once we were in the room. I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me. He began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me. I yelled, hoping someone downstairs might hear me, and tried to get away from him, but his weight was heavy. Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was so drunk, and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes. I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me. Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They both seemed to be having a good time. Mark was urging Brett on, although at times he told Brett to stop. A couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me, but he did not.\" Many reacted to Ford's testimony with compassion. Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan tweeted, \"I can't imagine how many thousands of women, around the world, are in tears as they listen to Christine Blasey Ford's voice cracking.\" The tweet received more than 1,000 retweets and 5,000 likes in 24 hours (shown below, left).[22] Others were dismayed by the questioning and descriptions of Dr. Ford, particularly Senator Orin Hatch referring to her as \"attractive.\" Reporter Kate Irby tweeted, \"Hatch just called Ford an 'attractive witness.'[23] Asked to elaborate what he meant, he said 'she\u2019s pleasing.'\" The tweet received more than 6,000 retweets and 10,000 likes in 24 hours (shown below, center). President Trump's son, Donald Trump, Jr, cast doubt on the testimony, specifically when Ford said that she had a fear of flying. He tweeted,[24] \"I\u2019m no psychology professor but it does seem weird to me that someone could have a selective fear of flying. Can\u2019t do it to testify but for vacation, well it\u2019s not a problem at all.\" The tweet received more than 8,000 retweets and 28,000 likes in 24 hours.      Kavanaugh continued to deny the allegations in his testimony. In his opening testimony, he said, \"My family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed by vicious and false additional accusations\" (shown below).  Female Attendee Reaction Images During Kavanaugh's testimony, people online shared an image of how the women seated behind Kavanaugh were reacting. Many inferred that there facial expressions were grimaces of disgust toward Kavanaugh (examples below).      Women For Kavanaugh On September 25th, 2018, the Facebook[30] group Young Women for America at Liberty University posted an event entitled \"DC Trip to Support Judge Kavanaugh.\" The group announced their intentions to bring women form the University to Washington, D.C. for the \"i Stand With Brett\" rally, an pro-Kavanaugh event. That day, Right Wing Watch reporter Jared Holt tweeted[31] a picture of the bus, which featured a large image on the side that a featured the slogan \"Women For Kavanaugh\" (shown below).    As the crowds gathered for the hearing, reporters began posting images of women wearing the \"Women For Kavanaugh\" shirts (shown below, left).[32] However, a photograph of a man wearing the shirt also grew in popularity. Twitter[33] user @MonicaCKlein tweeted the photograph with the caption, \"Meet the Women for Kavanaugh.\" The post received more than 3,000 retweet and 16,000 likes in 24 hours.     Alyssa Milano Conspiracy Theory During the hearing, some on Twitter noticed the appearance of actor and activist Alyssa Milano in the hearing using a phone, despite phones being barred. Twitter user @Fuctupmind tweeted a video made by Milano and the caption, \"Someone explain to me why Alyssa Milano was allowed to record this footage of the Brett Kavanaugh hearing today? This footage was directly from her device and she was told by security to shut it off. Is it a violation to record in a hearing room, even though it's an open one?\" The tweet received more than 4,100 retweets and 5,100 likes in 24 hours.

He believes that Milano was \"showing someone the layout and the distances,\" and after she created a distraction, \"SOMEBODY ELSE would do something.\" The post received more than 3,300 retweets and 3,900 likes in 24 hours (excerpts below).[35]    Confirmation Vote Following the hearing, key vote from Senate Judiciary Committee member Jeff Flake became the subject of much interest. On September 28th, Flake announced that he would be voting for Kavanaugh.[36] That day, CNN tweeted, a video of Flake being confronted by a woman in an elevator. She said, \"That\u2019s what you\u2019re telling all women in America, that they don\u2019t matter. They should just keep it to themselves because if they have told the truth you\u2019re just going to help that man to power anyway.\" The tweet received more than 21,000 retweets, 43,000 likes and 2.3 million views.

They should just keep it to themselves because if they have told the truth you\u2019re just going to help that man to power anyway.\u201d pic.twitter.com/T7fSpyT69E\u2014 CNN (@CNN) September 28, 2018     The vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee moved forward along party lines, with Republican Senators voting 11-10, moving the vote to Senate. However, Flake, as well as Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski announced that they would not vote to confirm Kavanaugh in the senate without the FBI background investigation, which was agreed upon.[37] On October 5th, Senators Susan Collins and Joe Manchin announced that they would vote to confirm Kavanaugh, all but ensuring his confirmation.[54] That day, Collins delivered a speech as to why she would be voting to confirm the judge (video below). Kavanaugh was voted to confirm Kavanaugh in a 50-48 votes. He was sworn in on October 6th as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court by Chief Justice John Roberts.[57]  Second Allegation On September 23rd, The New Yorker[17] reported a second allegation of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh. A classmate of Kavanaugh's at Yale between 1983 and 1984, Deborah Ramirez claims that Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her at a party in college. The report said: A third male student then exposed himself to her. \u201cI remember a penis being in front of my face,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that\u2019s not what I wanted, even in that state of mind.\u201d She recalled remarking, \u201cThat\u2019s not a real penis,\u201d and the other students laughing at her confusion and taunting her, one encouraging her to \u201ckiss it.\u201d She said that she pushed the person away, touching it in the process. Ramirez, who was raised a devout Catholic, in Connecticut, said that she was shaken. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to touch a penis until I was married,\u201d she said. \u201cI was embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated.\u201d She remembers Kavanaugh standing to her right and laughing, pulling up his pants. \u201cBrett was laughing,\u201d she said. \u201cI can still see his face, and his hips coming forward, like when you pull up your pants.\u201d She recalled another male student shouting about the incident. \u201cSomebody yelled down the hall, \u2018Brett Kavanaugh just put his penis in Debbie\u2019s face,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIt was his full name. I don\u2019t think it was just \u2018Brett.\u2019 And I remember hearing and being mortified that this was out there.\u201d  [\u2026]  And yet, after several days of considering the matter carefully, she said, \u201cI\u2019m confident about the pants coming up, and I\u2019m confident about Brett being there.\u201d Ramirez said that what has stayed with her most forcefully is the memory of laughter at her expense from Kavanaugh and the other students. \u201cIt was kind of a joke,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s clear to me it wasn\u2019t a joke.\u201d In response the allegations, Kavanaugh wrote in a statement: This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen. The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple. I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name--and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building--against these last-minute allegations. Kavanaugh's Calendars On September 23rd, Kavanaugh said that he would be releasing calendars from the summer of 1982 to the Senate Judiciary Committee.[18] The calendars, he says, do not include the party at which Christine Blasey Ford alleges Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. The calendar does include basketball games, trips to the movies, exercising and more. Following the announcement, people online mocked the idea that Kavanaugh had the calendars but did not release them when the allegations were first lodged. Sirius XM political analyst Zerline Maxwell tweeted,[19] \"If Kavanaugh had the calendar all along he would\u2019ve told us on day one. Additionally who put parties on their calendar at age 17?  This whole thing looks like a charade vs dr. Ford\u2019s methodical steps to corroborate her story.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 1,500 retweets and 5,900 likes in 24 hours. Others mocked Kavanaugh's personality for both keeping calendar and the idea tat he would keep a note about the alleged sexual assault (examples below, center and right).      Beach Week On September 26th, the Senate Judiciary Committee released the calendars to the public. That day, CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted[25] the calendars, which received more than 1,200 retweets and 2,400 likes in 24 hours (shown below).    Following the release of the calendars, people noted and joked about the presence of \"Beach Week,\" an official holiday in the Washington, D.C.-area in which graduating seniors and high school students engaged in behavior that included excessive drinking and sexual activity.[26] Atlantic writer Natasha Bertrand tweeted,[27] \"I distinctly remember being at a Beach Week party with my then-boyfriend when it dawned on us that there was a drunk girl in a room down the hall, and boys were \u2018lining up\u2019 to go in\u2026it happened often enough that we had a term. We didn\u2019t call it rape.\" The tweet received more than 4,000 retweets and 5,900 likes in 24 hours. Twitter user @grmarting tweeted,[28] \"this page from Kavanaugh's calendar looks like the cover to a seven-inch by some Pavement wannabe band called Beach Week.\" The tweet received more than 950 retweets and 5,500 likes in 24 hours. Others questioned what the inclusion of \"Beach Week\" contradicted his character.  Twitter[29] user @JoshDorner tweeted, \"From the yearbook: 'Beach Week Ralph Club \u2013 Biggest Contributor.' But he never drank to excess or illegally? Not sure how this is at all meant to be exculpatory or back up rather than contradict the choir boy claim\" (shown below, right).      Third Allegation On September 26th, 2018, Attorney Michael Anvenatti, the lawyer who also represented Stormy Daniels in her various legal disputes with President Trump,  tweeted,[20] \"Below is my correspondence to Mr. Davis of moments ago, together with a sworn declaration from my client. We demand an immediate FBI investigation into the allegations. Under no circumstances should Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed absent a full and complete investigation.\" The post received more than 13,000 retweets and 21,000 likes in 24 hours (shown below).     The declaration made by Julie Swetnick, a graduate of Gaithersburg High School, alleges that she attended parties with Brett Kavanaugh and Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge between 1980 and 1981. During that time, she says that she witnessed Kavanaugh \"drink excessively\" and \"engage in abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls, including pressing girls against him without their consent, 'grinding' against girls, and attempting to remove or shift girls' clothing to expose private body parts. She also attests to seeing Kavanaugh's behavior during the unofficial holiday of \"Beach Week.\" Additionally, she writes, under penalty of perjury, \"During the years 1981-92, I became aware of efforts by Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to 'spike' the 'punch' at house parties I attended with drugs and/or grain alcohol so as to cause girls to lose their inhibitions and their ability to say 'No.' [\u2026] I also witnessed efforts by Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be 'gang raped' in a side room.\" Swetnick continues that, too, had been sexually assaulted at a party but did not name Kavanaugh as the assailant. She wrote: \"13. In approximately 1982, I became the victim of one of these 'gang' or 'train' rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present. Shortly after the incident, I shared what had transpired with at least two other people. During the incident, I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me. I believe I was drugged using Quaaludes or something similar placed in what I was drinking.\" 1985 Bar Fight On October 1st, 2018, The New York Times[38] reported that in September 1985, Kavanaugh, then a junior at Yale University, and four other men were questioned, but not arrested by, New Haven Police Department in New Haven, Connecticut. The police report from the incident states that Kavanaugh was involved in an altercation at a bar following a concert by the band UB40. According to the report, Kavanaugh was accused of throwing ice at a patron. In a statement to the Times, Kavanaugh's classmate said: \"[Ludington] said that the altercation happened after a UB40 concert on Sept. 25, when he and a group of people went to Demery\u2019s and were drinking pints. At one point, they were sitting near a man who, they thought, resembled Ali Campbell, the lead singer of UB40.  \"'We\u2019re trying to figure out if it\u2019s him,' he said.  \"When the man noticed Mr. Ludington, Mr. Kavanaugh and the others looking at him, he objected and told them to stop it, adding an expletive, Mr. Ludington said.  \"Mr. Kavanaugh cursed, he said, and then 'threw his beer at the guy.'\" The references to the band UB40 became the subject of numerous jokes involving the band, who is best known for their brand of soft, radio-friendly reggae (examples below).[39]      The New York Times was subsequently criticized for the story, with some citing the inclusion of New York Times Opinion writer Emily Bazelon in the story's byline, particularly in regards to Bazelon's July 9th tweet about Kavanaugh. That tweet reads, \"As a @YaleLawSch grad & lecturer, I strongly disassociate myself from tonight\u2019s praise of Brett Kavanaugh. With respect, he\u2019s a 5th vote for a hard-right turn on voting rights and so much more that will harm the democratic process & prevent a more equal society. Those are fundamental values we try to instill in our students. They matter more than collegiality and credentials.\" The tweet received more than 1,000 retweets and 4,000 likes in three months (shown below).[40]    People stated their dismay toward Bazelon's work on the article. Twitter[41] user @BrentScher tweeted, \"The New York Times isn't even pretending anymore. The byline for the latest hit piece on Kavanaugh is a woman who stated her opposition to him on July 9.\" The tweet received more than 2,600 retweets and 4,900 likes in two days (shown below, left). Twitter user @HolmesJosh tweeted,[42] \"As someone who has worked with press my entire career, and respects the vast majority, this kind of thing destroys my ability to tell conservatives they\u2019re not out to get you. This is outrageous.\" The tweet received more than 790 retweets and 1,900 likes in two days (shown below, center). White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders tweeted,[43] \"Democrats desperately attack Judge Kavanaugh for throwing ice during college. What motivated New York Times reporter to write this ridiculous story? Throwing ice 33 years ago, or her opinion of Judge Kavanaugh in July?\" The tweet received more than 9,400 retweets and 29,000 likes in two days (shown below, right).      In a statement made on October 2nd, the New York Times released a statement on the controversy.[44] They wrote, \"Emily Bazelon is a writer for The New York Times Magazine who occasionally writes op-eds for the opinion section. She is not a newsroom reporter. Her role in this story was to help colleagues in the newsroom gather public documents in New Haven, where Emily is based. In retrospect, editors should have used a newsroom reporter for that assignment.\" Mark Judge's GamerGate Article On October 1st, 2018, Twitter[45] user @LasagnaGarden tweeted an article written by Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, a right-wing political commentator and writer, as well as one of the individuals accused by Blasey Ford of being present for the alleged attack by Kavanaugh, had published an article on the GamerGate controversy, an online gaming protest, which supporters claims is about \"ethics in gaming journalism,\" while other criticized the movement for inflaming sexist behavior in the gaming community, leading to excessive trolling, harassment and threats of violence. @LasagnaGarden commented on the article, entitled \"Why Gamergate is Really About Political Correctness,\" \"LMFAO HOW.\" The tweet received more than 885 retweets and 3,100 likes in two days. The articles were archived.[46][47]    In the article Judge refers to the attacks on Anita Sarkeesian, the blogger and video game critic, who received numerous death and rape threats, as well as doxing, for criticizing the GamerGate movement as well as perceived sexist imagery and themes in video games, as \"disgusting, sad, and intolerable.\" Judge continues: \"Social justice warriors like Sarkeesian usually win by following a pattern: raise an issue, shame critics by appealing to emotion, bully, express a lot of rage and personal hurt, guilt opponents into acquiescence, then move on to the next target. But gamers\u2019 cogent counterarguments have made Anita Sarkeesian and Feminist Frequency irrelevant. Gamers keep gaming, and game makers keep making games. The controversy is ebbing, and soon the name Anita Sarkeesian will be a footnote in pop culture history. As for me, I\u2019m looking forward to playing Dark Souls III.\" Trump Mocks Christine Blasey Ford On October 2nd, at a rally in Mississippi, President Trump commented on the controversy regarding the Supreme Court nomination of Kavanaugh. During the speech, he appeared the mock Christine Blasey Ford, mimicking her testimony. NBC[48] reports: \"I had one beer!\" Trump said, characterizing Ford's testimony about her level of intoxication as a teenager when she says she was attacked at a small get-together in Montgomery County, Md., in the early 1980s.  \"How did you get home?\" the president asked, taking on the role of prosecutor.  \"I don't remember,\" he said in his Ford voice.  \"How did you get there?\" Trump continued in his reenactment of the Senate hearing.  \"I don't remember,\" he replied in the Ford voice.  Trump then mockingly asked and answered a series of questions with the responses \"I don't remember\" and \"I don't know.\"  Intern Doxing Arrest On October 3rd, 2018, U.S. Capitol Police arrested  Jackson A. Cosko, an intern for Representative Shelia Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, for sharing the personal information of various GOP lawmakers, including the phone numbers and home address of Senators Mike Lee, Lindsey Graham, Orin Hatch, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Rand Paul, on their respective Wikipedia pages.[51] FBI Investigation Conclusion On October 4th, 2018, the White House said that the FBI had completed the investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. The information, known as \"302\" forms, would be made available to all 100 senators only. The report will not be made public but instead be held in the classified area of the Capitol Visitor's Center, where senators can read the files. However, copies of the findings will not be made as the report can only be read in the classified area.[49] Following the conclusion, key Republican votes for Kavanaugh's confirmation signaled their satisfaction with the investigation. Republican Senator Susan Collins said, \"It appears to be a very thorough investigation, but I\u2019m going back later to personally read the interviews.\" Additionally, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said, \"We\u2019ve seen no additional corroborating information.\" Democratic opponents of the confirmation criticized the investigation. In a series of tweets, Senator Tim Kaine wrote,[50] \"This so-called \u201cinvestigation\u201d is a complete sham. This process was wrapped up in just *5 days,* despite the many witnesses pleading to share relevant information who were ignored by the FBI.\" The tweets received more than 1,500 retweets and 4,000 likes in 24 hours (shown below).    Kavanaugh's Wall Street Journal Op-Ed On October 4th, 2018, Kavanaugh published an article in the Wall Street Journal[52] newspaper entitled \"I Am an Independent, Impartial Judge.\" In the piece, he seemingly apologizes for his testimony during the hearings with Christine Blasey Ford. He said, \"I was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said. I hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son, husband and dad. I testified with five people foremost in my mind: my mom, my dad, my wife, and most of all my daughters.\" Additionally, he vowed to be an \"impartial\" Supreme Court justice. Bar Association Re-Evaluation On October 5th, 2018, the Bar Association sent an email to Senator Chuck Gassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the letter, they wrote that they would be re-evaluating Kavanaugh's rating with the bar association regarding Kavanaugh's temperament (shown below).[53]    George Soros Conspiracy Theory On October 5th, 2018, President Trump tweeted,[55] \"The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad. Don\u2019t fall for it! Also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love! #Troublemakers.\" The post received more than 37,000 retweets, 118,000 likes and 48,000 comments in 24 hours (shown below).    Some criticized the comments and the allusion to the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that American investor George Soros was paying protester. This conspiracy theory, which Trump has perpetuated before, has been seen by some as anti-semitic. In an opinion piece on the tweet, The Washington Post's[56] Richard Cohen writes: \"If it was anyone else, this would seem to be base anti-Semitism. Soros is both rich and Jewish, and is officially and incessantly reviled in his native Hungary by the right-wing, authoritarian regime of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The campaign there against Soros, who survived the Holocaust through guile and luck, could be called vaguely anti-Semitic, but there is nothing vague about it. Soros is the representation of the rich Jew, an anti-Semitic stereotype which, in Hungary at least, endures.  One might think Trump is appealing to a similar mob. But the president is clearly no anti-Semite. Two of his lawyers over the years -- Roy Cohn and Michael Cohen -- were Jewish, as have been many of his other associates. His daughter converted to Judaism and his grandchildren have been raised in that faith.  So what you have is not anti-Semitism by intent, but it is anti-Semitism nonetheless. The president, I guarantee you, knows nothing about Hungary\u2019s history, nor that Adolf Eichmann managed to round up the country\u2019s Jewish population and have about 437,000 of them murdered at Auschwitz. Trump probably knows little about Soros, either, because he knows little about almost everything. He is a genius at ignorance.

Ruth Bader Ginsberg's Kavanaugh Swearing-In Reaction On October 8th, President Trump held a swearing-in ceremony for Kavanaugh. During the ceremony, many watching the ceremony noted the facial reaction of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, which appeared to show disdain and/or disapproval for the ceremony. Many online related to this expression and shared the image on various social media sites. That day, Twitter[58] user @MollyJohnFast tweeted the image with the caption, \"RBG is every democratic women in America right now.\" The post received more than 900 retweets and 3,700 likes in 24 hours (shown below, left).

The trailer also introduced a new exclusive power up for Toadette, the Super Crown, which allowed her to transform into a humanoid version called Peachette.                     Spread After the trailer aired, the appearance of Peachette caused confusion among the Super Mario fandom. Polygon[1] posted a satirical investigation into the implications of Peachette, asking questions like:  \"As if that is not enough, there\u2019s also the question of why Toadette choses [sic] to replicate Peach\u2019s form so closely? Is she envious of her supreme ruler? Is Peach some ideal she strives for, the perfect form of femininity that all Mushroom people uphold? Or is this something darker? Does Toadette want to usurp Peach? Does she want to become her?  Kotaku[2] also covered the announcement by delving into fan theories about the implications of Peachette, suggesting, \"The introduction of Peachette invites new theories, chief among them that Peach used to be a Toad herself but has since evolved thanks to her own gold crown.\" Kotaku points to a thread on ResetEra[3] which suggests that Peach as a monarch has deliberately kept magical hats away from the race of Toads to keep them subservient. Additionally, artwork from 80s Super Mario Brothers lore was investigated by Twitter users, which shows Peach, then known as \"Princess Toadstool,\" looking similar to a Toad (shown below).    Online, Twitter users parodied the story implications of \"Peachette.\" For example, Twitter user @hudkips posted a mock-introduction of an essay about the topic, gaining over 2,700 retweets and 9,600 likes (shown below, left). User @TannerLPer suggested that Peachette implies that humans in the Super Mario universe are simply evolved Toads (shown below, right).      New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe Website On January 4th, 2019, ResetEra forums member JB2448 submitted a thread titled \"It's canon that only Toadette can use the Super Crown,\" which contained a screenshot from the official New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe website stating \"Sorry Luigi \u2013 only Toadette can use this item!\" (shown below).                       Character Derivatives Bowsette Bowsette is an anthropomorphised genderbend version of the Super Mario villain Bowser caused by the effects of the Super Crown power up. Following the creation of the character by Twitter user @ayyk92 shortly after the release of a trailer for New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe, it quickly gained a large amount of popularity on both the western and eastern web.    The comic inspired myriad edits with subtle changes alongside her own fan art. Examples were posted to Twitter and Tumblr by Matt Froese (shown below, left), @SuperSatanSon (shown below, middle), and eritiacoli (shown below, right).

Highly visible memetic content campaigning for the character's inclusion dates back to the development cycle of the third iteration of the crossover fighting game, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, in 2007 and 2008. In late 2007, Geno was featured in the flash animation \"Smash Kingdom\" by Newgrounds user Araskin500, which later received sequels also making use of the character. These videos mark a very early acknowledgement in a substantial piece of content of the character's popularity as a Smash candidate (shown below).  It was later rumored online following the release of  Brawl that the delays thereof had to do with Geno, and that Nintendo, having intended to include him, was forced to remove him from the game for legal reasons with Square. Geno himself is owned by Square Enix, not Nintendo, which is widely considered to be the main obstacle to his inclusion in Super Smash Bros.. When Final Fantasy character Cloud was introduced to Super Smash Bros. as a playable character in downloadable content for the series' fourth game, thus establishing Square's participation with the series, a costume based on Geno usable by customizable Mii fighters was included in the same update as a nod to the character's fans. The same costume later returned in Ultimate with the release of fellow Final Fantasy character Sephiroth. Playable fan-made Smash mods implementing the character started surfacing around 2016 (example shown below).  Ahead of the release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Geno ranked very highly in certain fan-polls.[2] In September of 2018, he was ranked #2 in WatchMojo's video considering the top ten most fan-wanted characters for Ultimate.  He was also one of the characters included in the infamous \"Grinch\" banner hoax.

So, some weeks ago my friend and I decided to do LSD, and so we did. During the night around 4am my friend and I went outside to let the dog out and to look at the thunderstorm and it started pouring rain so we got into my friends car. We sat in there and watched the rain, smoked a cigarette, and we saw some random ass dude come out of nowhere and it freaked us out. Anyways. His mom came out and yelled at us to get inside and we got out and it was so damn awkward because she knew we were on something but we denied it. The other day I went and stayed at my friends again and he told me his mom thinks him and I are gay together and thought we were having sex in the car. Keep in mind, i'm a guy, my friends a guy, are we are straight asf. And i'm just sitting there in his room watching a movie and his fucking mom comes by his door, looks at me, and says \"I better not hear no cheeks clapping tonight\" and proceeded to make fun of my friend and I. Just thought I would share.                     Spread The story was a quick hit on the subreddit, and stories featuring the phrase \"clapping cheeks\" began being posted in the subreddit. For example, straightpipedkia[2] posted a parody of the original post by telling it from the mother's perspective, gaining over 1,600 points. Other users took the approach of spreading the meme through a bait-and-switch copypasta, telling a long story before revealing the \"clapping cheeks\" punchline.

FEMA to ICE Controversy On September 11th, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon released a document showing the Trump Administration had moved nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE)[3] for the purpose of funding detention centers, which were controversial earlier in 2018 during the Family Separation Policy controversy at the U.S.-Mexico border. The document from the Department of Homeland Security notes that the funds were taken from \"the agency's budgets for travel, training, public engagement and information technology work\" and not the disaster relief funding. The money also is less than 1% of FEMA's $1.03 billion budget. Merkley appeared on The Rachel Maddow Show that evening to discuss the document.                     Online Presence Prior to the hurricane's landfall, internet users joked about it in several ways. For example, several satirical Facebook groups and events were created, including \"Sacrifice FL to appease Hurricane Florence,\" which gained over 4,100 \"attendees,\"[4] \"Take Hurricane Florence and Push It Somewhere Else\", which gained 11,000 \"attendees\"[5], and \"Playing Nickelback & Creed to scare Hurricane Florence away,\" which gained over 2,600 \"attendees.[6] Local South Carolina news site Post and Courier[7] posted a roundup of Hurricane Florence-related memes (examples shown below).

While the original post appears to have been deleted, the image was tweeted by New York Times writer Kevin Roose on September 24th, 2018, who debunked it as photoshopped.

The Series has since been reuploaded after the deletion of the Jim81Jim channel.  Internet Aristocrat After deciding to abandon the Jim81Jim channel, Jim went on the create his second identity, The Internet Aristocrat. It's with this character that Jim flew into the spotlight. As The Internet Aristocrat, Jim criticized and mocked SJWs (Social Justice Warriors) in several new series. In Tumblrisms (Below Left) Jim mocked Otherkin, Feminists, Furries, etc. while his other series, The Hugbox Chronicles (Below right) is a series that mocked the responses Jim received from his Tumblrisms series.  ,   GamerGate Involvement    As Internet Aristocrat, Jim uploaded a video titled \"Quinnspiracy Theory: The Five Guys Saga,\"  which criticized indie game developer Zoe Quinn for her actions in GamerGate. Jim coined the term Quinnspiracy which refers to the fact that Quinn allegedly slept with five different men who had positions in the video game or video game journalism industries, to artificially inflate the positive ratings of her game.  This is what many consider too be the bomb that really thrust GamerGate into full swing.  After a few months of GamerGate, at some point Jim decided to abandon the character of Internet Aristocrat due to him deciding that the SJW videos had been played out enough, he was not enjoying making the content anymore, and he was not a fan of how popular he was becoming. The channel was deactivated but many if not all of the videos have been saved due to archivists.                    Mister Metokur Six months after his GamerGate departure, Jim reappeared under his current alias, Mister Metokur and started up 3 new series: Hollowed Halls (below left), Internet Insanity (below center), and The /x/ Files (below right), of which only Internet Insanity remains.  , ,   TGWTG Series On Apr 30, 2017, Jim  uploaded episode one of his TGWTG series which documents specific content creators featured on ThatGuyWithTheGlasses.com such as Doug Walker, Linkara, Angry Joe, Spoony, and many more.  Tales of Trout Series On Dec 21, 2017, Jim uploaded episode 1 of his Tales of Trout series in which he chronicles the Kraut & Tea Discord Server Leaks. This marked the first video in which he goes after prominent Anti-SJW figures such as MundaneMatt, Sargon of Akkad (below right), and others.  ,   MundaneMatt Meltdown On August 13, 2018, Jim uploaded a video entitled The Ballad of MundaneMatt, in which he goes through Matt's career as a prominent Anti-SJW Youtuber. He starts out by addressing Matt's prominent role in GamerGate which thrust him into the spotlight but then spends the rest of the video addressing the allegations that Matt has been flagging videos about himself that he disagrees with. Near the end of the video Jim finally gets Matt to admit to his actions. This event ruined Matt's reputation and he is rumored to have lost 2 months of subscribers in just a few days.                     Personal Life Little to nothing is known about Jim's life outside of the internet. According to a thread on /pol/ Jim is most likely not even his real name. Jim's face has also never been revealed though many pictures exist claiming to be of Jim. The two most popular images that are reported as being Jim are below.   ,   The one on the right is said to be Habermann, a former partner of Jim's. We also know he has girlfriend and they were both nearly doxxed during GamerGate. Other than that, \"Jim\" is a mystery.

The purpose of the meme goes over the intense fandom surrounding the character (and the lack of seriousness cohering to the original game of the fandom, such as several Alternate Universes and little to no involvement with the actual media, as well as canon defilement surrounding the game as a whole).", "origin": "The Post", "other_text": "Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce Vinny Sexual Misconduct Allegations        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       History The Post In some time estimated to be in the month of December, 2017, O.P. Lowernorfair posted the phrase \"Oh fuck dude watch out! It's Sans Undertale!\" comically on his tumblr. However, since conception, the recipient of the message, Relishboi, responded with the phrase \"please don't post him please please i'm begging you\" in all bold lettering. This seemingly added satirical heat and irony to the post. So, using the momentum of the post shortly thereafter, Lowernorfair responded with the most famous component of the post, a poorly edited image of Nagito Komaeda from Super Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair with several features edited in, as well as unironic similarities kept that were almost identical to that of Sans (Short stature (Edited in), Winter Coat (Unchanged), Missing Hair (Edited in), as well as very similar character personalities in their respective media). The Image also had very small unintelligible text made difficult to read due to spastic unedited white around it as well as Komaeda. He put a single caption in large bold under the image simply saying \"OH GOD HE'S HERE.\"  Finally, a third individual enters the discussion and begins the seemingly unironic coddling of the Meme's nature. A user named TheLovelyTrixie pitches in with an equally confusingly analytical and watered down reaction of the following: \"WHAT? That\u2019s not Sansy. That\u2019s some person from like Attack on Titan or whatever. The image is so poorly edited, and you can tell it\u2019s a JPEG because of the white around it. At least they got the hall right\u2026 where Sans and Frisk have the final showdown in the No Mercy run of Undertale.\" The series caused quite a stir, and not necessarily a negative one. Though the O.P. Lowernorfair has supposedly deleted his tumblr and began re-directing to their main one when attempting to directly view the gold-star post, it still lived on through several reposts the following weeks, months and beyond yet ahead, even to date. Music Videos and Crackshipping Several ironic as well as unironic YouTube videos rose up in the following weeks. One of the earliest being \"Sans Undertale Komaeda remix (warning: extremely cursed)\" by fuck bees, which featured the Image accompanying the 'Sans; Stronger than You cover alongside several audio clips of Komaeda's Japanese VA's laughter, which was really the only difference from the main track that was noteworthy. This video amassed 15,724 views as of September 11th 2018. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB4oPO4nlN0 The most iconic of these came around at the later in the life-cycle of the anti-meme; In a similar vein to the previous video, another user 'only sadness remains' uploaded a video titled \"MMD \u2013 Sans Undertale x Nagito Komaeda (fingers in his ass)\" which featured the video of an MMD of Sans and Komaeda dancing on a flowerbed from Undertale (which he credited to be by Skeletortilla from Tumblr) and the audio of \"Fingers in his Ass\" by BotanicSage, which used Asgore's theme as well lyrics sung by BotanicSage about the embargo on memes using any lyrics or samples from any of Kanye West's music. The original song in question was taken down due to obviously using Kanye's samples as well as harassment of Kanye with very NSFW imagery, but it managed to pass by in the MMD Music Video. The video amassed a total of 160K views as of September 11th, 2018. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5azNTnaOI The song most likely used BotanicSage's track due to it's relevancy to Undertale as well as comic NSFW appeal, little did most know that this would begin to the shipping of Komaeda and Sans, as a Crackship. The circumstances are very similar to the meme surrounding the Crackshipping (See Crackshipping: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/shipping) of Shrek from the Dreamworks Megahit 'Shrek' as well as Shadow the Hedgehog from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, where the two are pictured together in a very uniquely out of character romantic relationship between one another. Since the underhandedness and irrelevance of this Meme were at play in it's favor at the time, Cringeworthiness was the one biggest thing this meme had out of it's favor in the public, even closer along the lines to the Shadow X Shrek meme. Drawing Similarities As the meme went onward, it mainly was never really put in the forefront due to how much prerequisite information and context was required to understand the meme. So for the most part, the only ones who understood the meme were that of the Danganronpa and Undertale fandoms respectively, whilst still mingling with other fandoms had the occasion arisen (Such as Zero Escape or Homestuck, sister fandoms to Danganronpa and Undertale in that order.) The major work at play here was with major characters that all pertained similar character traits to Undertale characters, keeping tradition of remembering similarities between Sans and Komaeda. So dominantly, the Danganronpa fandom was more active due to the assumptively sensitive nature of the Undertale fandom, keeping the themes around of overbearing fandom collapsing in on itself (due mainly to Sans' existance in the media and the care put into AU's and whatever else involves Sans). Mainly, the fans of the Danganronpa fandom expressed their artisanship and appreciation of the Post and it's ironically enjoyable origin of the meme. Some however, legitamately took this meme to heart and dedicated AU's to the meme surrounding Danganronpa and Komaeda being Sans, and some wrote ironic confessions referencing it to remind others of it's existance (I.E. Confessions, Shitposts and memes along a similar vein of Sand Undertale, possibly attempting imitation.) Images displaying such similarities are within the following links: https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e1b1a49755b328df6abbcadf58849f04/5BFB0550/t51.2885-15/e35/29402312_463558014077639_2509228118909124608_n.jpg (Cosplayer, imitating the image almost exactly.

Reception Early reviews for the film were extremely positive. As of September 11th, 2018, the film has a score of 89/100 on Metacritic[2] and a score of 95/100 on Rotten Tomatoes.[3] After the film showed at the Toronto International Film Festival, Vanity Fair[4] reported it \"ran away with all the Oscar buzz.\" Variety[5] reported that both Gaga and Cooper could be up for Oscars for the film.

Twitter user @FightOnGaga[8] pointed it out on June 6th (shown below, left). On June 8th, a post on Gaga Daily[9] asked for memes from the trailer, and several users posted Lady Gaga-themed versions of the Cooper/Gaga Dialogue template. Among them was a post by user @bornthatwayy that gained over 1,600 retweets and 4,300 likes (shown below, right).     After the film premiered in Venice, the format began seeing more traction on Weird Twitter with contexts that had nothing to do with Lady Gaga or the film. For example, on Sepember 1st, user @Pattymo posted a version with a factoid about Mr. Belvedere, gaining over 470 retweets and 4,300 likes (shown below, left). User @briceezell posted a football-related version on September 11th, 2018 (shown below, right).     \"Why Did You Do That?\" \"Why Did You Do That?\" is a song from the A Star Is Born soundtrack. Unlike other, more serious songs from the soundtrack, \"Why did You Do That?\" is a song about how the singer finds butts attractive in cute jeans.  In context, the song is supposed to represent how the film's protagonist Ally creates a less-authentic, albeit successful, cheesy pop song. Critics were split on the song's quality. Vulture wondered, \"Is it terrible, is it a bop, or is it a terrible song that\u2019s also a bop?\"[9] Jezebel wrote, \"Hear that, Jackson Maine? Ally does have something to say and it\u2019s that cute butts drive her insane.\"[10] Fans were also divided in their response to the track. User @drewariana tweeted a Worried Jay-Z GIF representing his conflicting feelings about the song (shown below, left). User @tribranchvo tweeted a Charizard and Dragonite Dance Remix to the track, gaining over 5,400 retweets and 14,000 likes (shown below, right). The Daily Dot[11] wrote an extensive piece covering the breadth of reactions and pondering the question the song is intended to pose in the film, which is whether the cheesiness of the song prevents it from being considered \"good.\"                        Search Interest                        External References  [1] Wikipedia \u2013 A Star Is Born [2] Metacritic \u2013 A Star Is Born [3] Rotten Tomatoes \u2013 A Star Is Born [4] Vanity Fair \u2013 How A Star Is Born Ran Away with All of Toronto\u2019s Oscar Buzz [5] Variety \u2013 Oscar Voters Are Sure to Go Gaga for Bradley Cooper\u2019s \u2018A Star Is Born\u2019 [6] Facebook \u2013 A Star Is Born [7] Reddit \u2013 /r/movies [8] Twitter \u2013 @FightOnGaga [9] GagaDaily \u2013 ASIB memes [9] Vulture \u2013 I\u2019m Obsessed With That Song About Butts From A Star Is Born [10] Jezebel \u2013 'Why Did You Do That?'

The dispute began when Ramos gave Williams a code violation for coaching after noticing her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, making a hand gesture in Williams's player's box (shown below).[10] Mouratoglou later admitted that he was attempting to coach but stated that this is common practice within the sport.  Coaching or not ?#usopen pic.twitter.com/OATS0LE2Y2 \u2014 Ashish TV Slams (@ashishtvslams) September 8, 2018   Williams interpreted the violation as an accusation of cheating and approached Ramos during the match to defend herself (video below). She told him, \"I don't cheat to win. I'd rather lose.\"  Later in the match, Williams threw her racquet to the ground and broke it. The move is an automatic code violation, which resulted in a point penalty due to the fact that Williams had already received a code violation for coaching earlier.   sonofthebronx: Serena Williams slams down her racket ESPN U.S. Open Tennis: Women's Championship https://t.co/bWabazCyBn pic.twitter.com/RpvnKd5Syx\u2014 FanSportsClips (@FanSportsClips) September 8, 2018     Following the second violation and subsequent point penalty, Williams and Ramos continued to argue. Williams, who maintained her innocence for the first violation, insisted that Ramos apologize for what she saw as an attack on her character. In a series of arguments, Williams said, \"For you to attack my character, then something is wrong,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. You are attacking my character [\u2026] You will never, ever, ever be on another court of mine as long as you live [\u2026] You are the liar. When are you going to give me my apology.

William maintained that she had been treated unfairly, accusing the official of exemplifying a double standard by treating her differently than he would a man. In her post-match press conference, Williams said, \"He\u2019s never taken a game from a man because they said \u2018thief,' but I\u2019ve seen other men call other umpires several things.\u201d  Several celebrities on Twitter agreed with Williams, including champion tennis player Billie Jean King (shown below, left), talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres (shown below, center) and actor Reese Witherspoon (shown below, right).      However, some agreed with the official. Sports commentator Stephen A. Smith said Williams was wrong, pointing to various examples in which men had been given violations for similar actions.

Herald Sun Cartoon Controversy On September 10th, 2018, The Herald Sun[12] Australian newspaper published a cartoon by Mark Knight of the match between Williams and Osaka, portraying Williams with enlarged red lips and a squarish body jumping on her racquet (shown below), and the umpire saying to Osaka, who is portrayed as having white skin, \"Can you just let her win?\"    Following its publication, many criticized the cartoon as having the similar designs to racially insensitive cartoons. Twitter[13] user @TByrne75 tweeted, \"Undeniable facts about that #markknight cartoon :  1. Williams is depicted with exaggerated racial features. 2. Her Japanese opponent is depicted as having blonde (!!) hair. 3. The Portugese umpire is depicted as being Anglo-Saxon.

Twitter[14] @stonecold2050 tweeted, \"Shame on racist Mark Knight the cartoonist for Melbourne\u2019s Herald Sun.

Twitter[17] user @NerdPyle tweeted, \"In case you were wondering, the racist charicature of Serena Willliams drawn by Mark Knight is strongly backed by his employer, the Herald Sun, which is a subsidiary of News Corp Australia, a subsidiary of News Corp, which is chaired by Rupert Murdoch, owner of Fox News.

The book was a subject of several controversies,[1] partly due to gruesome scenes of violence. The original publisher Simon & Schuster withdrew from the project due to \"aesthetic differences,\" with the novel instead being published by Vintage Books. In Germany the book was deemed \"harmful to minors.\" Film On April 14th, 2000, thriller film American Psycho based on the novel was released.[2] The film is co-written and directed by Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron and stars Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman (fan-made trailer shown below).  In 2002, a direct-to-video stand-alone sequel American Psycho II: All American Girl was released.[6]                    Reception The film received polarized reviews, with some critics praising the writing and Christian Bale's performance and other criticizing it for its violent nature.[3] On Rotten Tomatoes,[4] the film maintains a 70% critic score with 151 aggregated reviews and a 85% audience score with over 304,000 user ratings.

Impact In late 2000s and 2010s, the film gradually developed a cult following indicative by a number of meme associated with the film and particularly its main character Patrick Bateman. A 2008 music video for Kanye West's song 'Love Lockdown' (shown below, left) and 2014 music video for Maroon 5's song 'Animals' (shown below, right) were both inspired by the film.[7][8]     A 2015 album American Beauty/American Psycho by Fall Out Boy takes half of its title from the book and the film.[9]                    Related Memes American Psycho spawned multiple memes, with the meme popularity of the film starting with the use of a still image of Bateman pointing at his audio system on 4chan as the Dubs Guy. Dubs Guy / \"Check 'Em\" Dubs Guy, or Doubles Guy, refers to an image of the protagonist Partrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) from the 2000 black comedy film American Psycho, which is used on 4chan in anticipation of submitting a GET post ending in double-digits. The image is often accompanied by the phrase \"check em,\" alerting viewers to examine the post number.    Patrick Bateman With an Axe Patrick Bateman With an Axe is a popular reaction image. The image also inspired fan art and redraws.      Do You Like Huey Lewis & the News? Do You Like Huey Lewis & the News? refers to a copypasta in which Patrick Bateman talks about his affinity for the 1980s band Huey Lewis & the News and briefly reviews their 1983 and 1987 albums Sports and Fore!  Do you like Huey Lewis & The News? Their early work was a little too 'new-wave' for my taste, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own \u2013 both commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humour. In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is 'Hip To Be Square', a song so catchy most people probably don't listen to the lyrics \u2013 but they should! Because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself!  Patrick Bateman Holding an Album The still image of Patrick Bateman holding the 1987 album \"Fore!\" by Huey Lewis and the News saw use as an exploitable, often used in combination with the \"Do You Like Huey Lewis & the News?\" copypasta.      American Psycho Business Card American Psycho Business Card refers to a series of parodies and remixes of a memorable scene from the film in which characters compare each others' business cards.  American Psycho Sex Scene / Arm Flex American Psycho Sex Scene refers to several meme formats based on the sex scene from the film, including a reaction image of the main protagonist Patrick Bateman pointing and winking, and multi-panel exploitable in which Bateman looks at a TV screen and reacts by flexing his bicep.      Patrick Bateman Talking on the Phone The image of Patrick Bateman holding a phone has seen use as a reaction image, often accompanying various imaginary dialogues.     Based Patrick Bateman / Chad Patrick Bateman In late 2010s, Patrick Bateman became generally recognized as a figure within the Chad archetype, with users utilizing images of Bateman to present various opinions they would deem based.

No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.

Spread On December 15, 2013, Warframe user and artist Datareaper posted \"The Chronicles of Clem, [A] Grineer lancer who wanted to be a Tenno.\"[3] to his Tumblr account, which depicted Clem as a Grineer defector and his attempts to become a Tenno. As of September 2018, the post has gathered 1,000 notes. Datareaper would later design the Kronen[11] bladed tonfas for use in Warframe itself, which was one of three designs selected as part of a weapon design contest held in December 2013.[4]        Datareaper's original set of comics. Note that some of the comics refer to mechanics that are no longer in the game as of this writing. Datareaper would continue to make comics about Clem which would influence most depictions of Clem in the Warframe community, such as his choice of armor customizations, limited vocabulary (consisting mainly of \"Clem\" and \"Grakata\") and overall personality.         As time went on, Warframe's developers Digital Extremes became aware of Clem's existence and stated that a minor NPC players could encounter in any Relay[12] was Clem himself, working for a group of Grineer defectors known as Steel Meridian.[13] Clem would be formally introduced in the game on September 17th, 2015 with the release of Hotfix 17.4.3[5] in the side quest A Man of Few Words.      In the quest, the players are contacted by Darvo,[14] a black market merchant allied with the Tenno, to help rescue an undercover contractor captured by the Grineer. Said contractor turns out to be Clem himself,[6] and after the players help get Clem his weapons back, Darvo sends both Clem and the Tenno to recover the artifact Clem was originally in charge of getting before his capture. Clem's depiction throughout the quest acknowledged Datareaper's depiction of Clem, albeit with slight adjustments. As another nod to the Warframe community, Darvo refers to the artifact as the \"P-otent O-rokin T-echnical A-ugmentation and T-actical O-ffensive device\" or \"Potato\" for short, \"Potato\" being a slang term for certain upgrades in the game that allow for further customization of player equipment.       Clem's popularity increased following the release of A Man of Few Words. On November 14th, 2017 Warframe was nominated for \"Best Ongoing Game\" at The Game Awards 2017,[7] On December7, 2017, on the official Twitch stream of the ceremony the chatbox was flooded with spam of \"Clem\", must to the consternation of some users. This was documented by Reddit user Firinael and posted on the Official Warframe subreddit.[8]                         Related Memes Two Grakata One of the first comics drawn by Datareaper about Clem showed an Excalibur[15] insisting that Clem use a Latron[16] semi-automatic rifle (a Tenno weapon) instead of the Grakata[17] submachine gun (the standard-issue weapon of Grineer Lancers like Clem), to which Clem responded by holding up a second Grakata and saying \"Twooo Grakata!\"    Both the comic and Clem's response quickly spread within the Warframe community, with many players demanding for a \"Two Grakata\" weapon to be added into the game. On July 31st, 2015 the Official Warframe YouTube channel uploaded a video titled \"Warframe | Echoes of the Sentient Highlights\" and briefly featured Two Grakatas being dual wielded, though not actually fired. The same day, Update 17.0 was released[9] and added the \"Twin Grakatas\" secondary weapon,[10] which Clem himself would wield when he was added to the game later.        Following the Twin Grakatas' release, many players jokingly started making hypothetical Grakata-themed weapons for other weapon categories, such as hammers, throwing discs[18], and flak cannons.[19]                            Search Interest                        External References  [1] Warframe Forums \u2013 Update 10: Shadows Of The Dead \u2013 PC Update & Build Notes \u2013 Warframe Forums [2] WARFRAME Wiki \u2013 File:Ket klem.ogg | WARFRAME Wiki | FANDOM powered by Wikia (unavailable) [3] Datareaper's Art \u2013 Datareaper's Art, The Chronicles of Clem, Grineer lancer who wanted\u2026 [4] Warframe Forums \u2013 Phase 1: Melee Weapon Concept Submissions \u2013 Livestreams & Contests \u2013 Warframe Forums [5] Warframe Forums \u2013 Hotfix 17.4.3 \u2013 PC Update & Build Notes \u2013 Warframe Forums [6] WARFRAME Wiki \u2013 Clem | WARFRAME Wiki | FANDOM powered by Wikia [7] archive.org \u2013 The Game Awards 2017 [8] reddit \u2013 The Game Awards' Twitch chat right now [9] Warframe Forums \u2013 Update 17: Echoes Of The Sentient \u2013 PC Update & Build Notes \u2013 Warframe Forums [10] WARFRAME Wiki \u2013 Twin Grakatas | WARFRAME Wiki | FANDOM powered by Wikia [11] Wiki \u2013 Kronen [12] Wiki \u2013 Relay [13] Wiki \u2013 Steel Meridian [14] Wiki \u2013 Darvo [15] Wiki \u2013 Excalibur [16] Wiki \u2013 Latron [17] Wiki \u2013 Grataka [18] Reddit \u2013 New!

The \"waste of your time, and ours\" line also became a subject of online and parody, as did Gu's simple response: \"Got it. Thanks.\" As of August 30, 2018, Gu's post had gained upwards of 800 reactions and 250 comments.                    Developments On August 29, 2018, the story was reported by Above The Law, an online news source devoted to the legal community.[2]  The article caught the attention of Jay Edelson, the founder and CEO of Edelson P.C., who wrote a response to Above The Law.[2][4] Jay Edelson explained the impetus behind his response as follows:  Partly because my internet is for some reason struggling to find new cat videos for me to watch and partly because some people are being asked questions about this, I wanted to send this email to provide the full context of what happened and our thoughts more generally.  The response explained the decision to reject Gu, noting that this was not the first time Gu had interviewed with Edelson P.C. In his first on-campus interview (OCI) as a first-year law student, Gu apparently showed up late to the interview wearing sweatpants.[3] Edelson P.C. interviewed Gu again as a second-year law student, following strong references from a law professor. Again, Gu showed up to the interview late. Though Gu received an offer for a callback interview, he waited nearly three weeks before attempting to schedule the callback--a fact corroborated by Gu's own screenshot of the exchange.  Jay Edelson concluded the response with the following:  I have more to say, but the cat videos are calling. -Jay  The response sparked additional online reactions, which derided Gu's attempts at garnering sympathy after wearing sweatpants to a job interview.  The response itself was also the subject of criticism.  Some found the references to cat videos cringey, while others noted that the firm should have simply taken the high road by apologizing. Gu's Reply Gu disputed the claims in Jay Edelson's response, and wrote a reply to Above The Law:[2]  I wanted to set the record straight on a factual issue in Mr. Edelson\u2019s response: I have always worn 100% wool slacks in my interactions with his firm.  Gu's insistence that he wore \"100% wool slacks\" generated further parodies, with many comparing sweatpants to professional attire.  Others noted that the phrase \"100% wool slacks\" did not actually rebut Edelson's claim that Gu wore sweatpants to the interview, as slacks can include any kind of casual trousers.

In 1997, Gulshan was killed by the Indian organized crime group D-Company. As of 2018, the company is led by his son Bhushan Kumar and Gulshan's younger brother Krishan Kumar. In 2006, the company started up their Youtube channel on March 13th,[1] the oldest video available on the channel being \"Patiala House\" Official Trailer 2 | Akshay Kumar\", with over 492,000 views as of writing and uploaded on December 23, 2010 (shown below, left).

The company also has a network of 25 other channels available, such as T-Series Apna Punjab and T-Series Kids Hut with varying sub counts ranging from the hundred thousands to the millions. It is predicted that T-Series' main Youtube channel is set to surpass PewDiePie as the most subscribed Youtube channel on the site in a matter of months, with Socialblade predicting T-Series reaching 70 million subscribers in November 2018. The company overtook number one most subscribed channel position on April 14th, 2019, following a month of back-and-forth lead changes. On April 15th, 2019, T-Series established a 100,000 subscriber lead over PewDiePie.  100 Million Subscribers Milestone  At approximately 5:50am EST, May 29th, 2019, T-Series became the first YouTube channel to reach 100 million subscribers. On the same day, T-Series announced the achievement in the company social media accounts, also updating the YouTube banner.[2]      The news was covered by several notable news outlets, including LADbible[3] and Independent.[4] Discussion Videos In 2018, the channel garnered notoriety for it exponential rise on the site from numerous YouTubers, including Pyrocynical, who described PewDiePie in this situation as \"one Swedish man against all of India\" in response to the growth of T-Series (shown below, left).

Theories A number of theories have been made as to T-Series increase in growth on Youtube, with some accusing the channel of view and sub bots on the channel, alongside remarking T-Series' disproportionate like-to-follower amount on Twitter. However, others have provided their own theories, such as attributing the rise to India's increasingly large online presence, with more and more Indians connecting to the internet. One video from channel Coffee Break discussed the latter and was uploaded on August 18, 2018.

The Silent Era The first animated film that\u2019s known was created in 1908 by French Artist, \u00c9mile Cohl, called Fantasmagorie, the film consisted of a stick figure encountering various morphing objects, as well as sections were a live-action hand entered the scene. [3] During the 1910s, the industry started being commercialized by the showing of animated shorts like this one in Movie theatres.  The first cartoon character that was successfully marketed was Felix the Cat, created by Otto Messmer in 1920 (though most of the credit was taken by Pat Sullivan, the head of the studio), Other earlier silent cartoon characters include Gertie the Dinosaur, by Winsor McCay, and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, by Walt Disney. [4] [5]  The first animated feature film to be entirely made of hand-drawn animation was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs made in 1937 by Walt Disney [6]. While the first animated television show was released by Hanna-Barbera in 1958, The Huckleberry Hound Show.[7]                    Important Companies and Channels (WIP) Notable Icons (WIP) Many western animated shows and characters have gained large notoriety all throughout the world, garnering large amounts of fans and universal recognition. They've become an integral part of western culture, some important examples include: Mickey Mouse    Mickey Mouse [8] is an anthropomorphic cartoon mouse created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928. He currently serves as the current mascot of The Walt Disney Company and is one considered one of the most recognizable characters of all time. Looney Tunes    The Looney Tunes is an American animated series of shorts films produced from 1930 to 1969 by Warner Bros, which introduced numerous popular cartoon characters including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, and many others. Over time, the Looney Tunes have become Warner Bros' main franchise, creating tons of television shows, theatrical films, video games, music, and amusement parks, among other things. Bugs in Bunny, in particular, is regarded as a cultural icon has even received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

He used his reputation and popularity to run two unsuccessful campaigns for United States President.", "origin": "Naval Careeer", "other_text": "Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce Vinny Sexual Misconduct Allegations        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       History Naval Careeer In 1958, McCain graduated from the United States Naval academy. Shortly after, he served in the Navy during the Vietnam War, where he was captured and held as a prisoner of war from 1967 to 1973.[1] His experiences as a P.O.W. informed many of his politics on war and torture, which would be key platforms in his political career. Career In Government In 1982, McCain began the first of two terms in the United States House of Representatives, serving Arizona's 1st district from January 1983 to January 1987. As his time in the House of Representatives came to an end, McCain was elected to the United States Senate, succeeding Barry Goldwater. Presidential Campaigns In 2000, John McCain ran his first presidential campaign, failing to receive the Republican nomination for president, which eventually went to George W. Bush, who would win the presidency. Following the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001, McCain would become a supporter of Bush's military invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Eight years later, he did receive the Republican nomination for president, running against then-Senator Barack Obama in the 2008 United States Presidential Election. As his running mate, McCain selected former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin for vice president. On October 11th, 2008, about one month before the election, the Associated Press published a video of McCain defending Obama against detractors who mischaracterized McCain's opponent as \"Arab.\" The video (shown below) received more than one million views in ten years.  Relationship With President Trump During the President Election, in 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump repeatedly criticized John McCain. He said of Trump, \"He\u2019s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\"[2] Following the 2016 United State Presidential Election, which resulted in the election of President Donald Trump, John McCain emerged as a supposed political opponent of President Trump. McCain became a hold out vote against Trump's repeal of the Affordable Care Act, before voting against it.[3]     However, despite this perception, McCain continued to vote for much of the president's policies, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which largely undid his vote against the Affordable Care repeal in July 2017. The New York Times[4] reported that McCain voted for the president's policies 83% of the time. Shortly after his death, while many around the country kept their flags at half staff in commemoration of McCain, the White House raised its flag at full staff, which some believed to be an insult to McCain. However, after a brief backlash, the White House lowered the flag once again to half staff.[6]   FULL STAFF: As American flags across the nation continue to remain at half staff to honor John McCain, the flag on top of the White House has been brought to full staff, less than 48 hours after the senator and war hero's death. https://t.co/DZUsRMtUXM pic.twitter.com/Ooz3c5yCSR\u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) August 27, 2018     Death On July 14th, 2017, it was reported that McCain had undergone surgery to treat a blood clot behind his left eye. Days later, the surgery revealed the presence of an aggressive brain tumor called glioblastoma. Despite treatment, McCain's conditioned worsened. On August 24th, 2018, McCain's family announced that he would no longer receive treatment. He died the following day. He was 81.[5]                    Related Memes Zombie McCain One of many political gaffes to emerge from the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election, Zombie McCain is a photoshop meme that spawned from a puzzling photo of four-time Arizona Senator John McCain (shown above) taken shortly after the third and final presidential debate with Barack Obama in October 2008. The photograph captured the Republican nominee for President in an awkward stance with his tongue hanging out and it quickly became fodder for photoshop exploitables.    #Unfollow McCain #UnfollowMcCain refers to Twitter users unfollowing Arizona Senator John McCain after he tweeted that he was 74 followers away from 3 million, and was hoping to reach that number. This led to thousands of Twitter users unfollowing McCain, presumably in response to their displeasure that McCain voted for the controversial Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Melee in his home country of Chile.[5] While much of his early competitive history is unknown, prior to his first international tournament appearance at Apex 2012, Barrios became the best Super Smash Bros Brawl player in his home country, utilizing Meta Knight. With continued appearances and strong tournament showings in the United States, he became one of the best players in Brawl prior to the release of Super Smash Bros for 3DS and Wii U.     In early competitive Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, Barrios dominated the tournament scene by winning 56 consecutive tournaments in a row, including the prestigious Smash for Wii U event at EVO 2015, before his winning streak ended at MLG World Finals 2015 when he lost to Nairoby \"Nairo\" Quezada in the finals. After a brief hiatus from the game due to medical reasons, he returned to competition. Though not as dominant, he still held a reputation as one of the best players in the Smash for Wii U scene up until his retirement from the game.     On November 7th, 2018, Barrios announced his return to competitive Smash Bros. upon the release of Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, along with signing to eSports team Tempo Storm, and hosting a Reddit AMA on r/smashbros[7].                     Reputation Gonzalo Barrios' dominance at Super Smash Bros for Wii U was covered by gaming journalism outlet Kotaku in a piece focusing on the most notable gamers in the year of 2015.[1] Barrios' dominance was also included in the Guinness World Records Gamer Edition 2017 as a result of his uncontested 56 (misprinted as 53) tournament win streak.[2] Barrios is proficient in other Smash games as well, known for being the best player of the Brawl mod Project M for a time, and being a respectable player in Super Smash Bros. Melee, having gone toe to toe with top players such as Adam \"Armada\" Lindgren and good friend Jason \"Mew2King\" Zimmerman.                        Personal Life Gonzalos Barrios was born on April 17th, 1995 and grew up in Chill\u00e1n, Chile. He became engaged to his girlfriend in November 2015. Barrios' signature scarf was a gift from his mother when he left Chile. Prior to his retirement, Barrios had a bodyguard attend him at tournaments after receiving numerous death threats from those envious of his dominance and proficiency at Smash for Wii U.[6] Barrios has a YouTube channel where he posts gameplay analysis and highlighted clips from his Twitch streams.[3][4]                    Related Memes \"So A Lot of People Have Been Wondering\u2026\" \"So A Lot of People Have Been Wondering\u2026\" is a phrase that was often said by Barrios at the start for his videos discussing his thoughts on topics relating to the meta of competitive Super Smash Bros for Wii U. Due to the repeated usage among his earlier videos, it became a memetic phrase associated with Barrios within the Smash community.

Twitter uyser @Melljoee tweeted,[13] \"It is appropriation. It's my culture.

Ash Ketchum's Age Ash Ketchum's Age, also postulated in the question \"How Old Is Ash Ketchum?\", is a popular topic of debate among the fans of the Pokemon franchise regarding the ageless appearance of the main protagonist character in the animated series. Ashachu Ashachu is a fan made name for the instance in a episode of the Pokemon Anime episode in which Ash gets transformed into a Pikachu. Ever since then, the variation of the character has been subject to various works of fan material. Ash Steals A Motto Ash Steals A Motto is a Youtube fad based off of an episode of Pokemon. The fad is based off of a scene from an episode in which Ash is asked to give a motto for battling styles. The original line is replaced with a classic line from other references (ie. Youtube Poop, other online videos, etc.) This is a newer fad as the episode only premiered in the English version this year, and the edited line is from the English dub of the show. This meme/fad, being rather new, leaves videos with a relatively low amount of views, but given time, they should become relatively popular. The edited scene begins with Candice asking Ash to give a motto, and Ash takes a moment to think of something to say. When he does say it, the line in question is edited with said replacements, usually completed with the rest of the scene. The line is usually no more than 10 seconds long. Cute Ash Cute Ash refers to fan interpretations of Pok\u00e9mon character Ash Ketchum as he appears in a trailer for an upcoming Pok\u00e9mon motion picture to be released July 13th, 2018.

The Lightning Thief would later be followed up with four more books in the series: The Sea of Monsters, published on April 1st, 2006[4], The Titan's Curse, published on May 1st, 2007[5], The Battle of the Labyrinth, published on May 6th, 2008[6], and the last book in the original series, The Last Olympian, published on May 5th, 2009.[7] The entirety of the series alongside companion books, sequel series, and other related media, would be categorized under a media franchise known as the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles.[8] Related Content The Heroes of Olympus    The Heroes of Olympus is the sequel series to Percy Jackson and the second series in the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles.[9] Introducing a focus on Roman mythology, the series debuts and emphasizes focus on new locations such as Camp Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Camp Half-Blood located near San Francisco, and characters such as Jason Grace, a son of Jupiter, and Piper McLean, a daughter of Aphrodite, as they, along with faces new and old, become the center of a new prophecy to save the world.[10]  The series started in 2010, with the release of the first book in the series The Lost Hero, first published on October 12th[11], and was followed by the yearly release of the books The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena, and The House of Hades, until the final book, The Blood of Olympus, was published on October 7th, 2014[12], for a total of five. The Trials of Apollo    The Trials of Apollo is the third and current series in the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles and the follow-up to The Heroes of Olympus.[13] Inspired by tales and myths of Apollo being banished to the mortal world[14], this series centers around the Greek god Apollo, flung down to Earth as a mortal without powers after angering Zeus, and his adventures at Camp Half-Blood as his human form, the 16 year-old Lester Papadopoulos, as he tries to gain the forgiveness of the Olympians with the help of returning characters and new ones such as Meg McCaffrey, a daughter of Demeter.[15] The series began in 2016 with the release of The Hidden Oracle, first published on May 3rd[53], and is still ongoing. The final book in the series, The Tower of Nero, is to be released in September 2020.[16] Other Series Characters from Percy Jackson and the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles as a whole have had cameo appearances or mentions in other series by Rick Riordan, specifically The Kane Chronicles and Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard, with the three series mentioned all taking place in the same universe, known by most fans as the Riordanverse. All three series deal with the same premise of gods and mythology hiding or blending into everyday life while also containing a sense of adventure and the same genre of urban fantasy, with the theme of Egyptian mythology and Norse mythology respectively. The character Magnus Chase is canonically referred to as a relative of Annabeth Chase[34] for instance, with Annabeth even appearing in the first book of Magnus Chase[35], though The Kane Chronicles' interactions in the universe are more limited to short stories and brief mentions, allusions, and cameos.[36][37] Adaptations Movies In 2010, the first book was adapted into a movie, Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, first released on February 2nd for Canada and February 12th for the US. The film was directed by Chris Columbus[17] and released by 20th Century Fox after originally obtaining the film rights in 2004.[18] The film would later receive a sequel based upon the second book, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, directed by Thor Freudenthal and released on August 7, 2013.[19] The films starred Logan Lerman, Brandon T. Jackson, and Alexandra Daddario as Percy, Grover, and Annabeth respectively (trailers shown below).     Upon release, both received mixed to negative reviews from critics[20][21][22][23] and are generally looked down upon by the fandom[24][25][26] due to unfaithfulness to the source material, with Riordan himself having a particular distaste towards them, even penning a letter to teachers saying to provide alternative activities than watching the movie adaptations[27] alongside either expressing disdain for and jokingly dismissing the existence of the movies on social media[28][29], the latter being an action also taken by a majority of the fandom. Riordan would later release two emails sent to the producers for the movies detailing further criticisms with the films.[54] Musical In 2017, an off-Broadway musical based upon the first book in the series titled The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical premiered on March 23rd at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in New York. Originally introduced by theater group Theatreworks USA in 2014[30], the musical has received positive reviews, with Frank Scheck, writing for the Hollywood Reporter, claiming that the musical \"proves far more enjoyable than the misbegotten 2010 film version or its 2013 sequel.\"[31] The musical received nominations in 3 categories at the 2017 Drama Desk Awards.[32] After its last show at the Lucille Lortel Theatre, the show began its National Tour in January 2019.[33] (trailer shown below)  Disney+ Adaptation Since Disney's 2019 acquisition of 20th Century Fox, who own the movie rights for the series, there has been speculation as to whether or not a new adaptation of some form would be created, due to the generally poor performance and reception of the Fox movies, especially as the company would be making new series based on old properties for its recent Disney+ streaming service. On December 10th, after the fan-driven hashtag #DisneyAdaptPercyJackson was brought to trending worldwide, including being covered by Twitter Events[73], Riordan revealed he was \"trying hard to convince the powers-that-be that this needs to happen for you.\"[74] Intermittent updates would follow, including a blog post on his official site.[75][76] On May 14th, 2020, Rick announced on Twitter a Disney+ live-action series that would adapt the entire original five-book storyline of the series would be produced, with the first season adapting the first book in the series The Lightning Thief.

On the book rating website Goodreads, The Percy Jackson series[8], and the main entries in the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles[38], have all averaged a rating of around or somewhat over 4 stars out of 5, with the highest ranking book in each series being The Last Olympian, The House of Hades, and The Burning Maze, with a 4.50[39], 4.55[40], and 4.39[41] out of 5 respectively. The series has also been listed as a New York Times children's series bestseller having been on the list for 458 weeks by the end of 2017[42], alongside the books in the series being as a best-seller in other newspapers[43][44] and earning literary accolades such as the first book earning the 2008 intermediate level Young Reader's Choice Award[45] and the distinction of being marked as a Notable Children's Book by the American Library Association in 2006.[46] Some criticism has been directed towards Riordan's focus on pagan gods, however, especially Christian critics, though Riordan responded in an interview on his site, saying that in regards to the first book, it \"explores Greek mythology in a modern setting, but it does so as a humorous work of fantasy. I\u2019m certainly not interested in changing or contradicting anyone\u2019s religious beliefs,\" also adding that one character makes a clear distinction between the Abrahamic God, and the Greek gods of myth, even mentioning that the issue of God is something he doesn't want to delve into.[2] Rebecca Read, writing for The New Yorker, makes mention of how the series' juvenility, termed as \"teen goofiness,\" has turned away adult readers, unlike the Harry Potter series, which has been embraced by both adults and children alike.[52]                    Online Relevance On Twitter, Rick Riordan's official Twitter account has over 672,000 followers.[55] The official Twitter for the Lightning Thief musical has also garnered over 51,800 followers[56] while the Twitter account for the Riordan-affiliated site Read Riordan has over 27,900 followers.[57] A subreddit dedicated to the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles and its affiliated series was started by Redditor Guyinthehall8 on October 4th, 2011 and has since gained over 34,000 subscribers.[58] A wiki also exists for the entirety of the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles and related series with over 2,000 pages since creation.[59] Facebook and Instagram accounts for the users of the aforementioned Twitter accounts also exist with the Facebook pages at over 130,000 followers[60], over 18,000 likes[61] and over 2.3 million likes[62], respectively. On Instagram, the accounts have over 607,000 followers[63], over 56,800 followers[64], and over 135,000 followers respectively.[65]                    Fandom On Deviantart, results for the search term \"percy jackson\" rack up a total of over 104,000 total results[66], with \"the heroes of olympus\" and \"the trials of apollo\" garnering less results, with over 29,000[67] and over 3000[68], respectively. On Fanfiction.net, over 66,200 submissions are available, and 10.400 crossover works with other series and franchises, the most popular crossover choice being Harry Potter, at over 3,000 results.[69][70] On Archive of our Own, over 15,000 results are available for derivative literary work.[71] On Tumblr, numerous amounts of fan content can be found under tags such as \"percy jackson\", \"heroes of olympus\", \"trials of apollo\", and its abbreviated tags \"pjo\", \"hoo\", and \"toa\". Fan Art                         Related Memes Dam Jokes Dam Jokes refer to wordplay jokes and puns made to replace the curse word \"damn\" with the word dam, as in the barrier or blockade for water. The joke originates from the third book in the series, The Titan's Curse, where it is spoken by Zo\u00eb Nightshade, a member and Lieutenant of the Hunters of Artemis, while at the Hoover Dam, saying that they should \"find the dam snack bar\", before being followed up by other puns using the word dam, such as \"dam T-shirt\", \"dam French fries\", and \"dam restroom\", despite Zo\u00eb not understanding the joke to begin with.    Uncle Rick Uncle Rick is a nickname associated with the author of the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles and its associated series, Rick Riordan. Originating in 2013 from Brazilian fans, who affectionately called him \"Tio Rick\"[72], the name has since seen widespread usage among fans of the Riordanverse, with some common moves and tricks becoming associated with him, such as never letting characters catch a break or rest after the end of the series, creating and messing with ships, and cliffhangers that don't get followed up until at least a year later, when the next installment usually releases.

The package caused an uproar among \"Book Twitter,\" a collection literature fans and people in the publishing industry.", "origin": "", "other_text": "Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce Vinny Sexual Misconduct Allegations        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       Background On August 14th, a screenshot from the Instagram story of user librovert showing the dick soap received in gift box for the book A Court of Thorn and Roses began circulating around Twitter (shown below).    The package was crafted by Yaira Lynn of Bookish and Stuff, who creates gift packages as part of a \"Book Boyfriends\" series,[1] and is not a licensed package from the book's publisher. The A Court of Thorn and Roses package also included erotic fan art and fanfiction about the characters.            Developments After the image of the Dick Soap hit Twitter, many users raised issues about the package for a variety of reasons, some of which were based on a misunderstanding of the genre for A Court of Thorn and Roses. The book is New Adult, which means it is intended for college-aged readers and contains graphic sex scenes. However, many users thought the book was a Young Adult novel, meaning for teenagers not of legal age, and expressed outrage at the concept of gifting children graphic materials. User @cupcakeandy expressed this concern, gaining over 300 likes, and so did user @laceliteracy, gaining over 175 likes.     Others expressed concern that the dick soap would be improperly used as a dildo, which is unhealthy and could lead to a yeast infection. User Sarah Hollowell begged users who received the box to not \"fuck the soap\" (shown below, left) and user @authorandiej expressed concerns about the potential health risks of trying to use the soap as a dildo (shown below, right).     Another issue users brought up with the package is that the selling of unlicensed fan fiction is illegal, meaning the erotic fan fiction included with the package was problematic. Examples of tweets about this topic came from users @jennifercarolyn (shown below, left) and @VictoriaAveyard (shown below, right).     Yaira Lynn defended the package on Instagram, saying that the package was perfectly in line with the content of the books and not unlike adult-themed gift packages sold in normal sex shops. The book's publisher, Bloomsbury, said they were aware of the package and clarified neither they nor Sarah J. Maas was associated with it.

From 1973 to 1978, she studied physics at the University of Leipzig, and later, received her doctorate in quantum chemistry from the Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Adlershof.[1] Following the fall of Berlin Wall, she joined the Democratic Awakening, which later merged with the East German Christian Democratic Union (CDU). In 1990, she ran for public office and was elected to the Bundestag, a legislative body of the German federal government.[2] Leader of the Opposition On April 10th, 2000, Merkel became the first female leader of a German party, the CDU. Her win was a shock to many within the party, given that Merkel is a centrist Protestant in a male-dominated socially conservative party with Catholic roots. However, her campaign for a fresh-start for the party won out. Merkel quickly became popular among Germans, who wanted her to run for Chancellor in 2002. After winning re-election that year for the CDU head, Merkel became Leader of the Opposition in the Bundestag, favoring reform for Germany's economic and social systems in an effort to make the country more competitive on the world stage and to strengthen ties to the United States. Chancellor of Germany On November 22nd, 2005, Merkel became the Chancellor of Germany. Following a stalemate election, the SPD grand coalition approved her leadership. She has since won three subsequent elections. During the 2015 European Migrant Crisis, Merkel's profile rose throughout the world. Unlike many in the EU, she ended the enforcement of EU regulations for asylum seekers and pledged to give general refuge to Syrians fleeing civil war. That year, TIME magazine named her Person of the Year, calling her the \"Chancellor of the Free World\" on the cover.[3]                       Reputation In addition to her stance on refugees, the rise of right-wing, nationalist politics in Europe, specifically in regards to Brexit and the 2016 Election of President Donald Trump, Merkel's profile continued to rise. The New York Times called her the Liberal West's Last Defender and the \"leader of the free world.\"[4] Additionally, following the Brexit decision in 2016, she has become the de facto leader of the European Union. Forbes has been named the the world's second most powerful person behind Vladimir Putin. As of 2016, she is the third most powerful person and the most powerful woman, according to Forbes.[5] As of March 2016, she had a 60% approval rating among german citizens.[6]                    Related Memes Neuland Neuland, German for \u201cvirgin territory,\u201d is a term used by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to describe the current state of the Internet during a joint press conference with President Barack Obama in Berlin on June 19th, 2013. Chancellor Merkel\u2019s remark was instantly met by derisive comments on Twitter, with many German Internet users ridiculing her use of the term \u201cneuland\u201d as being out of touch with the progress that has been made in the field. When discussing cybersecurity, she said:  \u201cWe talked about questions of the Internet in the context of PRISM. We talked at great length about the new possibilities and about also the new threats that the Internet opens up to all of us. The Internet is new territory, uncharted territory to all of us. And it also enables our enemies. It enables enemies of a free, liberal order, to use it, to abuse it, to bring a threat to all of us, to threaten our way of life. And this is why we value cooperation with the United States on questions of security.\u201d   Shortly after making the comments, the word \"neuland\" began trending on Twitter and many parodies about the word sprang up around the internet (shown below).      Angela Merkel and Barack Obama at G7 Summit Angela Merkel and Barack Obama at G7 Summit refers to a photograph of the two heads of state having a conversation to the picturesque backdrop of the German Alps during the 41st meeting held in Schloss Elmau, Kr\u00fcn, Bavaria, Germany on June 7th, 2015.    Upon entering online circulation, the photograph quickly became a subject of a photoshop meme on Twitter.      Handshakes With President Trump Since the beginning of the Trump presidency, many have commented on his antagonistic relationship with Chancellor Merkel, citing their first meeting as a prime example. On March 17th, 2017, Merkel visited the White House for the first time. After the two visited privately in the Oval Office, they posed for photographs, a traditional procedure for visiting dignitaries. However, the moment became a source of commentary when Trump, despite pleas from photographers and a request from Merkel herself, refused to shake the Chancellor's hand (video below).  Once the video and picture of Trump's supposed snub, the image became the source of memes and online mockery on Twitter.      On July 6th, 2017, Merkel and Trump met, once again, this time at the G-20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany. When the two took the stage together, they shook hands (shown below).    Many online were quick to comment on the surprised and confused appearance of both Trump and Merkel. This became the subject of mockery on Twitter, as people captioned the photo with various humorous and absurd scenarios, recontextualizing the photograph.      Shortly after this photograph hit the internet, another image of Trump and Merkel made the rounds. Captured, again, at the G-20 Summit in Hamburg, this photograph of Merkel, head in hands, as Trump talked to her, became a popular inspiration for image macros.      Angela Merkel made more handshake-related news, when she was the first to publish the handshake between Trump and Putin. Germany's Bundesregierung put a small video camera on their photographer, filming the meeting between Trump and Putin (shown below) and posting it to their Facebook page.  Merkel-Raute Merkel-Raute, German for \"Merkel rhombus,\" refers to Merkel's signature hand gesture she makes by resting her hands on her stomach so that her fingertips meet and her index finger and thumbs form a quadrangular shape. Sometimes referred to as the \"Merkel diamond,\" it is widely considered one of the most recognizable hand gestures in the world. Merkel says that she uses it because \"it contains a certain symmetry.\"    The CDU has appropriated the Merkel-Raute as a branding tool, and frequently uses the emoticon \"<>\" to represent Merkel. During her 2013 re-election campaign, the CDU used the hand gesture as a recognizable symbol for the candidate. Giant campaign posters featuring just Merkel's hands began appearing in Germany, a testament to the German people's familiarity with the gesture.[7]    The large-scale, digital version of the Merkel-Raute inspired the Tumblr page Merkelraute, in which the user would photoshop a top half of the pictures, lining up the pictures of her hands with another, generally, more absurd picture.8]                         Search Interest                        External References  [1] Wikipedia \u2013 \"Angela Merkel\":://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel [2] Wikipedia \u2013 Bundestag [3] TIME \u2013 Chancellor of the World [4] The Independent \u2013 Angela Merkel branded new 'leader of the free world' as Trump and Brexit preoccupy Western powers [5] Forbes \u2013 Angela Merkel [6] DW \u2013 Chancellor Merkel's approval rating rises in polls as parties stay close [7] The Guardian \u2013 'Merkel diamond' takes centre stage in German election campaign [8] Tumblr \u2013 MerkelRaute      Latest Editorial And News       How Standing On The Gravitron Became The Ultimate Meme Of Rebellion        TikToker Justine Paradise Accuses Jake Paul Of Sexual Assault        Legendary Rapper DMX Dies At 50        Maggie Goldenberger Auctioning Off Original \u2018Ermahgerd\u2019 Photo As Meme NFTs Continue Trending Online"}, "Length of Recording": {"image": "https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/023/369/Screen_Shot_2017-07-07_at_10.27.43_AM.jpg", "type": ["Snowclone"], "origin_year": "2016", "date_added": "2017-07-07T10:56:24-04:00", "views": 7243, "videos": 0, "photos": 15, "comments": 3, "about": "Length of Recording refers to a snowclone popular on Twitter in which a person posts what appears to be two audio files of two different lengths.

He would later post the pictures to Twitter, where they were again taken down.                       Developments Shortly after Kardashian's social media attacks began, Chyna responded in a now-deleted Snapchat (shown below), in which she accused him of physical abuse.

The offense could be punishable by up to six months in jail and a up to a $1,000 fine.[7] However, some have contended that this might not be technically revenge porn in this case. California attorney Paul Wallin, who has worked 50 revenge-porn cases, said, \u201cIt cannot be revenge porn unless the DA can prove she [Chyna] suffered emotional distress.\" Wallin continues by saying that because nude photographs of Chyna already exist online and because she \"liked\" the Instagram posts, proving that the posts caused her emotional distress becomes much harder.[8] Online Reaction Shortly after the pictures were posted, the \"Poor Dream,\" a reference to Chyna and Kardashian's daughter dream, started trending. In general, many online called Kardashian's actions \"revenge porn,\" posting about how such images were illegal in the state of California (examples below).      However, others were quick to comment on Kardashian's poor judgement in being in a relationship with her, posting gifs and pictures that expressed feigned surprise (examples below).

To date, their highest total raised is 2.2 million dollars, which the event raised in January of 2017.  Awesome Games Done Quick 2018 On January 7th, 2018, the winter Awesome Games Done Quick event began at the Hilton Washington Dulles. The event ran until January 14th, and set a new record for money raised by a Games Done Quick event, raising $2.26 million.[4] During the event, Twitch only allowed subscribers who paid a $5 per month subscription to access the chat feature.[5] This was done to combat spam problems that had plagued the chat in previous years. This led others to host Twitch streams on their accounts so posters could chat freely. During the event, several speed runs gained media attention. Deadspin[6] covered streamer Zallard1 beating Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! and Super Punch-Out!! simultaneously using one controller (video shown below, left). Kotaku[7] covered a stream of \"Resident Evil VII by streamer Carcinogen, praising Carcinogen's hosting ability and pointing out several humorous moments from the gameplay (shown below, right).    SGDQ 2018 On June 24th, 2018, Summer Games Done Quick began at the DoubleTree Hilton in Minnesota, and ran until July 1st. One of the most notable runs at the event was done by a program called TASbot. TAS, short for Tool Assisted Speedrun, allows developers to enter a frame-by-frame controller input to run a game to show a run that is theoretically possible but nearly impossible for a human to pull off. A TAS run of the platforming game Celeste generated headlines from publications covering the event, including IGN.[8]  Celeste was also raced at the event for the first time, and the game's creators appeared to commentate the race (shown below, left). Super Mario Bros 3 also was raced, and the race was praised by arstechnica (shown below, right).[9]     The tournament raised over $2.12 million for Doctors Without Borders.[10]                    Online Relevance Controversies As the event grew more popular, it has drawn criticism for the way it allocates donations and its vague rules and harsh punishments for streamers. On October 13th, 2016, prominent YouTuber covering Games Done Quick (GDQ) Apollo Legend released a video explaining why he does not support GDQ. Among his reasons, Apollo Legend notes that only about 60% of donations to Prevent Cancer Foundation go into research, while the heads of the organization take a hefty cut. He also notes that a large amount of the proceeds raised by GDQ goes into putting on the following GDQ event.  GDQ has also drawn criticism for banning speedrunners from attending for minor offenses. For example, In Apollo Legend's video, he discusses how a speedrunner was banned for waving a game in front of the camera he wanted to speedrun, allegedly circumventing GDQ's submission process. On the first day of GDQ's January event, commentator PvtCinnamonBun was seen allegedly wearing a Make America Great Again hat, which would violate GDQ's rules against streamers making political statements.[2] After the run he commentated, GDQ banned him from attending future events, though after reviewing the footage, PvtCinnamonBun was unbanned. Bonesaw577's Jak and Daxter Run One of the most notable bannings in GDQ history was of Bonesaw577. During the Summer GDQ of 2016, Bonesaw577 streamed Jak and Daxter. While on the stream, he swore multiple times, made several Owen Wilson jokes, and told viewers to tweet at Air Canada after his keys were lost on a flight to the event (shown below, left). While many found his performance charming, he was banned until 2018. Apollo Legend thought this was silly and posted a response video on September 21st, 2016, which garnered over 488,000 views (shown below, right).     R. White Goose and Graviton Bans On November 27th, 2018, Twitter user @Pizzaparty531 posted screenshots from a Discord chat between streamers R. White Goose and Graviton wherein they made sexist, transphobic, and anti-semitic comments, including some towards other GDQ streamers. She sent the messages to Games Done Quick, implying that it violated Games Done Quick's rules.[11]    Initially, Games Done Quick said that while the comments violated the organization's rules, they could not verify that R White Goose and Graviton had made the comments so could not take action. Later, after some blowback from the GDQ fans,[12] they reversed their decision, saying they were able to verify the comments were made by the speedrunners, and banned them from GDQ.     R White Goose said to Kotaku that he completely understood GDQ's decision and disavowed his comments.[12] Graviton said on Twitter he gained more followers for his \"wrongthink\" than he would have doing a GDQ stream.[13]                    Notable Events \"I'd Really Prefer If You'd Be Quiet\" On June 25th, 2014, during the Summer Games Done Quick 2014 event, runner CavemanDCJ performed a speedrun of the 1999 video game Toomba 2. Along the commentators there was runner Chibi, who would make several jokes and comments during the run, until Caveman requested them to stop and be quiet. The same day, YouTuber CrowBat uploaded a supercut version of the run, gaining over 2.6 million views in the following three years.     \"Crash 2 Is Essentially Domestic Abuse\" During the Summer GDQ of 2015, streamer gamerpro11 streamed Crash Bandicoot 2 in what would become one of the more notorious runs in the event's history. During the stream, he made repeated suicide jokes, said \"Crash 2 is Essentially Domestic Abuse,\" and said that he would become a psychopath and mass murderer. After the last line, his mic was cut.[3] He then purposefully crashed the game so he would not have to complete his run.

In the late-90s, The Hot Dog Eating Contest exploded in popularity thanks to six-time champion Takeru Kobayashi. Kobayashi shattered records in his first contest in 2001, where he ate 50 hot dogs, doubling the previous record of 25. Additionally, he introduced various techniques to the sport, allowing participants to more hot dogs and effectively helping competitive eating and the Hot Dog Eating Contest grow in exposure. In 2007, roughly 50,000 people attended the contest.  Kobayashi left the competition in 2009, after he refused to sign an exclusive contract with Major League Eating, who sanctions the contest. However, in 2011, Kobayashi competed unoffically,  by holding a private competition and beating champion Joey Chestnut's record.[5] In 2011, Sonya Thomas became the first Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest for Women champion, consuming 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes. She has since won the contest four times. Since Kobayashi has stopped competing, the running champion has been Joey Chestnut, who set a record in 2017, eating 72 hot dogs.

The post was subsequently locked by moderators of the subreddit.   \"First of all, I would like to apologize to the members of the reddit community for getting this site and this sub embroiled in a controversy that should never have happened. I would also like to apologize for the posts made that were racist, bigoted, and anti-semitic. I am in no way this kind of person, I love and accept people of all walks of life and have done so for my entire life. I am not the person that the media portrays me to be in real life, I was trolling and posting things to get a reaction from the subs on reddit and never meant any of the hateful things I said in those posts. I would never support any kind of violence or actions against others simply for what they believe in, their religion, or the lifestyle they choose to have. Nor would I carry out any violence against anyone based upon that or support anyone who did. The meme was created purely as satire, it was not meant to be a call to violence against CNN or any other news affiliation. I had no idea anyone would take it and put sound to it and then have it put up on the President's Twitter feed. It was a prank, nothing more. What the President's feed showed was not the original post that was posted here, but loaded up somewhere else and sound added to it then sent out on Twitter. I thought it was the original post that was made and that is why I took credit for it. I have the highest respect for the journalist community and they put their lives on the line every day with the jobs that they do in reporting the news.\"   Andrew Kaczynski's Investigation On July 4th, CNN[1] published an article by senior editor Andrew Kaczynski, who claimed he had tracked down the Reddit user who allegedly created the original GIF and threatened to \"publish his identity\" if he continued to \"repeat this ugly behavior on social media again.\"    On July 5th, Kaczynski tweeted that Redditor HanAssholeSolo is an adult and not a teenage boy as some had reported. On July 5th, the news site Ricochet[8] reported that Kaczynski had previously gained online notoriety for publicizing PR director Justine Sacco's controversial AIDS joke in 2013.    Online Reaction On July 4th, the hashtag #CNNBlackmail began trending on Twitter, with many criticizing the cable television network for threatening to release HanAssholeSolo's personal information for posting the animated GIF. Meanwhile, photoshopped images and animated GIFs about the controversy began reaching the front page of various subreddits, including /r/dankmemes,[5] /r/cnnmemes[4] and /r/memeeconomy.[6] Meanwhile, various internet users began referring to the backlash against CNN as a \"meme war\".

The character Abed warns Jeff, \"You are now creating six different timelines.\" The episode then shows what happens when each character picks up the pizza in a series of vignettes. In the character Troy's vignette, Troy leaves to get the pizza and a series of incredibly unfortunate events occurs, resulting in one character getting shot and the apartment lighting on fire (shown below, left). The episode ends with Jeff picking up the pizza and things returning to normal, but during the episode's credits, we see what the group's life is like in the future after Troy picks up the pizza, which Abed coins \"The Darkest Timeline\" (shown below, right).

On October 18th, 2016, The Angry Video Game Nerd published a video about the Berenstain Bears Mandela Effect that gained over 2.2 million views (shown below).  Meanwhile, the phrase was used often to relate to the candidacy/presidency of Donald Trump. In late 2016, The Mary Sue[7] posted an article comparing the Community episode to \"our own\" darkest timeline. Daily KOS[8] did the same a month later.

Castel's \"lavecin pour les yeux\" or \"harpsichord for the eyes\" was an instrument outfitted with sixty multi-hued lanters that illuminated when notes were played (shown below, right). Like a keyboard or synthesizer, different keys produced different colors. As Castel wrote, \"The pressing of the keys would bring out the colours with their combinations and their chords; in one word, with all their harmony, which would correspond exactly to that of any kind of music.\"     Art critic Roger Fry coined the term \"visual music\" in 1912. While many claim that Fry used the expression to describe influential visual musician Wassily Kandinsky,[1] other contend that the first usage of the term came in reference to the later work of Picasso. In the preface to the catalogue for post-impressionist exhibit he organized at the Grafton Galleries,[2] he wrote:  \"The logical extreme of such a method would undoubtedly be the attempt to give up all resemblance to natural form, and to create a purely abstract language of form -- a visual music; and the later works of Picasso show this clearly enough. They may or may not be successful in their attempt.\u201d  Throughout the 1910s, futurists Bruno Corra and Arnaldo Ginna produced films that experimented with color music. Mary Hallock-Greenwalt, additionally, made films that were visualization of musical form.[4] In May 1919, artist Thomas Wilfred enginnered the Clavilux, a device that culd be used for the performance of \"lumia,\" Wilfred's term for light art or color music (examples below). He built smaller versions of this type of instrument meant for home installation.     In the late 1940s, Oskar Fischinger, a leading artist in abstract musical animation and former Disney animator, developed the Lumigraph. Designed to be a commercial product, the Lumigraph worked by pressing a rubber screen, which would protrude into a narrow beam of light. While the device was silent, the it would be played with accompanying music.[6]    In 1995, the Animusic company launched to specialize in the 3D visualization of MIDI-based music.[7]           Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce Vinny Sexual Misconduct Allegations        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       Highlights In May 2002, Jarmo Niinisalo discovered two faces in the sound waves of the 1999 Aphex Twin single \"Windowlicker.\" According to Wired,[9] the faces (shown below) \"can be reproduced with a sample of the song and some spectrographic software, which displays the different frequencies of the song as a graph against time.

Automatic Mario Automatic Mario (\u81ea\u52d5\u30de\u30ea\u30aa) is a subgenre of remix videos that emulate popular songs and soundtracks through gameplay footage of customized level stages in Super Mario World. Mostly created by fans using Super Mario ROM editors, musical compositions in Auto-Mario videos are carefully prearranged by the architectural design of each level and thus rarely requires any input from the player. However, there are other types of Super Mario MOD levels that can be played manually or semi-manually with musical accompaniments.

Nhoooh! (\u3093\u307b\u3049!), Aheee! (\u3042\u3078\u3047!), Iguuh! (\u30a4\u30b0\u30a5), etc\u2026  Etymology In the name, \"Ahe\" comes from Japanese onomatopoeia of \"Aheahe\" (\u30a2\u30d8\u30a2\u30d8) describing female\u2019s flushed breath and moaning in sex and her sexual excitement, and \"Gao\" (\u9854) means \"Face\". According to a forum post in Nico Nico Pedia's entry for Ahegao[1], it's confirmed that the term had been already used in porn magazines to simply explain porn actresses' face of pleasure in early 1990s. Used in the same context, it also made appearances on a handful of posts in 2channel and its sister board community for adult contents BBSPINK as well as descriptions for porn videos on adult e-commerce sites in the first half of 2000s. The oldest 2channel post in existence that includes this term was posted to a thread in /company/ (tip-off) on November 4th, 2001.[2] Meanwhile, according to 2008-2009 Japanese blog posts WebLab.ota's \"Ahegao History\"[3] and \"Ahegao Chronology\" (shown below)[4], and Himajin no Dabun's \"Chronological Analyze of The Ahegao Genre in Adult Games\"[5], it was around 2003-2005 that some hentai manga and anime creators began introducing extremely exaggerated face depictions of women's abnormal orgasms by unwanted sexual intercourse, hardcore BDSMs, rapes or other sex assaults. Another blog post by Bar Rikashitsu no Bibouroku[6] suggested that Japanese ero guro[7] mangaka/painter Suehiro Maruo[8] had already introduced this kind of depiction to his works in early 1980s.    Ahegao Timeline (WebLab.ota, 2009) Following these prior researches on the web, Japanese bishoujo comic researcher Rito Kimi (\u7a00\u898b\u7406\u90fd)[9] compiled \"Genealogy of Ahegao\" in his 2017 book The Expression History of Ero-Manga (\u30a8\u30ed\u6f2b\u753b\u8868\u73fe\u53f2).[10] In this book, he points Hiromitsu Takeda's 2008 manga \"I \u2665 Scraper\" (\u3042\u3044\u2661\u3059\u304f\u308c\u30fc\u3071\u30fc) is the first commercial work where a character utters the word \"Ahegao\" in a meaning of this facial expression (Shown below), and it suggests Ahegao had established its own concept in the hentai subculture at that point. He also analyses that image board communities Futaba Channel (2chan) and Pixiv, where its users started to heavily use this technique for pure jokes like Ahegaokin around 2007, also had a critical role to spread the concept on the internet.   Man: \"Even your mom would have noticed by THIS Ahegao\"Woman: \"Ah!\" \"Huff..Huff!\" Ahegao in today's meaning was formed by increase and evolution of this drawing style in the middle of 2000s, and its spreading to the otaku community via 2chan, 2channel/BBSPINK which became to host Ahegao-themed threads around the middle of 2007[11][12], and matome blogs reprinting threads in those online communities. And in around 2008, it had enough spread to be recognized as one of famous drawing techniques for orgasms. The first Ahegao-themed doujin comic anthology \"A-H-E\" was released in the winter of that year (Shown below, left). In 2010s, major publishers had released Ahegao themed comic anthologies (Shown below, center) as well in its first half and even porn videos became to occasionally feature the facial expression (Shown below, right), along with popularization of hentai fetishes in the real-life sex industry.      Additionally, Ahegao, Ahegao-like silly faces, and its derivative Ahegao Double Peace became to be sometimes featured even in normal anime titles in the non-sexual context (Shown below).        From top left to bottom right: Fuse Kazakiri from A Certain Magical Index (2010), Miwako Mizukoshi from Hen Semi (2011), Honoka Kousaka from Love Live! (2013), Toko Fukawa from DanganRompa (2013)             Online Relevance Against the backdrop of the large popularity in the otaku community, which had been developed in the late-2000s, Ahegao has earned a lots of online visibility as both a hentai art technique and fodder for parody illustrations. In its early days, Ahegao had been a popular style in the Collage culture in 2chan and 2channel. And Japanese illustrators communities Pixiv and Nico Nico Seiga which were launched in the same period have been popular Ahgao-sharing services since its beginning. As of June 2017, Pixiv holds over 20000 illustrations tagged under Ahegao[13], and Nico Nico Seiga, which doesn't have the adult section, also has plenty of illustrations featuring the face.[14] On the Westerners Web, this particular facial expression is called in not only the original name, but also translated terms \"Fucked Silly Face\" or \"Mind Break Face\".[15] Tagged under these names, lots of Ahegao illustrations have been drawn by DeviantArt users[16], or reprinted to Tumblr and Danbooru. Urban Disctonary's article and Reddit's subreddit /r/Ahegao were launched in June 2010. Besides, Instagram's hashtag also has tons of Ahegao selfies by female otakus and cosplayers.[17]            Related Memes Ahegaokin Ahegaokin (\u30a2\u30d8\u9854\u83cc, lit. \"Ahegao Bacillus\") is a series of exploitables for the face. Triggered by an illustration which was inspired by 2chan's Ahegao photoshopped image of Suiseiseki from Rozen Maiden, lots of illustrations of characters being infected by the bacillus were uploaded to Pixiv in 2008-2009.    DESU DESU DESU DESU is a derivative of Desu meme and an Advice Dog spin-off which reused that Suiseiseki's Ahegao face. As early as April 2010, this series became to be shared on Meme Generator.[23]    Ahegao Double Peace As well as the face itself, its derivative Ahegao Double Peace (\u30a2\u30d8\u9854\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9) is also one the iconic poses in the hentai subculture and online parody illustrations. This quite weird pose had established its concept in the middle of 2011.    Baan Face Baan Face (\u30d0\u30fc\u30f3\u9854) refers to an Ahegao-inspired face and pose struk by Iroe Gennma a.k.a Nee-san in Japanese manga +Tic Elder Sister (+\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u59c9\u3055\u3093). Since its web anime series was published in 2011, this silly pose has been occasionally used in a motif for parody illustrations.[24][25]    Ahegao Fingers Ahegao Fingers is series of photoshopped images which came from Reddit's /r/dank_meme in May 2017.

During his career, he worked in promotions including WWF/WWE, WCW, ECW, and NJPW. He accumulated 22 championships, including two World Championships, one WWE Heavyweight Championship, and one WCW Heavyweight Championship. He won the main event at Wrestlemania XX. Death On June 22nd, 2007, Benoit murdered his wife Nancy Sullivan and son Daniel and then committed suicide. It was likely that Benoit had drugged his son before strangling him. It is believed that multiple concussions had led Benoit to have deteriorated mental health. Results of testing done on Benoit's brain after the murder revealed that \"Benoit's brain was so severely damaged it resembled the brain of an 85-year-old Alzheimer's patient,\" according to doctor Julian Bales of West Virginia University. Benoit was not mentioned for years on WWE television after June 26th, 2007.                    Online Relevance Conspiracy Theory The most prominent conspiracy theory about Benoit's double murder-suicide is that Benoit is actually innocent of the crime, and the real culprit is fellow professional wrestler Kevin Sullivan, Nancy Sullivan's ex-wife. On February 17th, 2014, an IGN[2] user posted \"24 Reasons that will prove that Chris Benoit is Innocent\" in a thread on the site's forum, citing some details of the case that suggest the officially given times of death and the events leading up to the double murder-suicide are not consistent with the police report. On May 14th, 2016, Top10Wrestling posted a video about the conspiracy that gained over 150,000 views (shown below).                     Related Memes The Dogs Are In The Enclosed Pool Area. On June 24 2007, before his death, Benoit sent a series of text messages to his co-workers between 3:53 AM to 3:58 AM, and one of them contained the following message: \"The dogs are in the enclosed pool area. Garage side door is open,\" evidently to tell people it was safe to come into his home to find the bodies. Due to the absurdity of the phrase, it has been used as an example of dark comedy to signify that a person is suicidal (or is just acting like they are). They are most commonly used in forums like SCJerk, Squaredcirclejerk where it has become an ironic meme.

This video game, usually called Futa Letter for short, was released in April 2010 by a Japanese doujin circle Hrathnir, in which the game's heroine Asuna Yamaguchi is depicted making the \"Ahegao Peace-Sign\" (shown below).    Asuna's Ahegao Peace-Sign in Futa Letter  Precursors Prior to Futa Letter, the same double peace signs with Ahegao-like face was often struck by Japanese idol/actor Shingo Katori[3] in 2009 TV drama adaptation for popular manga series Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K\u014den-mae Hashutsujo[4] (shown below, left), and his ridiculous face caught an attention as well as his awful acting in those days. Also, Shimbo Nomura's gag manga in 1980s Tsurupika Hagemaru[5] sometimes showed the protagonist Hagemaru's double V signs with silly face (Shown below, right). These similar expressions in gag manga became to be mentioned as early examples of Ahegao Double Peace after the pose's popularization on the web in 2010s.                Spread Later that year,  hentai creator Misakura Nankotsu (\u307f\u3055\u304f\u3089\u306a\u3093\u3053\u3064) promoted Asuna's Ahegao Peace-Sign, leading the images to circulate on 2channel, Futaba Channel (2chan), niconico and Twitter. On April 23rd, 2011, Kanimaru-kun, an official mascot character for the Kanie Town in Aichi Prefecture, was compared to the Ahegao Double Peace pose (shown below, left). The following month, the character Yuko Aioi in the anime television series Nichijou struck the iconic pose in its 8th episode of the show (shown below, center). Thereafter, Japanese online illustrator communities on Pixiv and Nico Nico Seiga circulated  a vast amount of hentai and parody illustrations featuring the pose.[6][7] A Shift-JIS art for the pose, v(\u309c\u2200\u3002)v , was also made in this period.  In 2013, the anime series  WataMote also parodied the Ahegao Double Peace in the ending credits  for the 5th episode of the program (shown below, right).      On May 25th, 2012, Takashi Otsuka[8], the director for TV anime Glitter Force/Smile PreCure![9], tweeted that he was feeling uncomfortable with some of the photoshopped images of the on-going child anime,[10][11] which many speculated referred to the Ahegao Double Peace depictions. Those images circulating on the social networking service and matome blogs were taken from 2chan or Pixiv (shown below).

On April 20th, Tumblr user kagrenacs[1] first brought the raid to light in a post discussing how a Tumblr user called neonjude deactivated after getting mad at kagrenacs' Elder Scrolls Headcanons. kagrenacs later got a notification from a user called nucleic-asshole that simply said \"Yerma favrit deputee.\" After doing some digging, kagrenacs discovered many posts where long threads featuring usernames that previously belonged to Nazi, pedophile, and TERF blogs simply replying \"Pardner.\"    These blogs all changed their profile image to a screenshot of Woody from an early test-screening of Toy Story (shown below) and many of the blog titles simply read \"Howdy, Pardner.\"  On June 27th, 2017, Tumblr user snoopingasusualisee[5] admitted that they started the Woody Collective \"about a year ago.\"[5]            Developments The roundup continued to grow over the next two months, as more and more blogs were claimed. Woody's Roundup generally responds to posts in which people proffer negative opinions either in reference to fandoms or real-life events by reblogging the post over and over with different taken usernames, adding the same content on every reblog (example shown below).    Roleplaying also takes place on these blogs. There are over 40 of these blogs and the number is rapidly growing as more and more blogs are being overtaken.[2] Many wide-spread blogs known for their racism or general nastiness have been claimed by the Roundup. The blogs claim to \"keep the Wild West safe from bandits and varmints.\" On June 21st, the account woodysroundup,[3] since deactivated, set forth the \"rules\" of the hivemind, nothing that only blogs that are considered problematic can be taken into the hivemind.    The response on Tumblr has been positive, as many on the site appreciate the trolling of blogs with problematic content. The event began getting covered by memedocumentation[4] on June 29th.     Aquafresh Tumblr Banning On April 29th, 2019, a Tumblr account parodying the Aquafresh Toothpaste brand with various shitposts (examples shown below) was deactivated by Tumblr moderators for alleged hate speech.     The account was relatively popular, with about 11,000 followers.[6] Followers assumed that the ban was due to Aquafresh posting Avengers: Endgame spoilers and blamed Tumblr's moderators for having a faulty system.[7] However, this was not the case. The person behind the Aquafresh Tumblr account was snoopingasusualisee, the person who started the Woody's Roundup trend. He, real name Josh, reported to New York Magazine[6] that he had received an email stating Aquafresh was banned for impersonation and that other accounts of which he owned the URL, hate speech blogs he had taken over during Woody's Roundup such as bayareanazi and fuhrerofgermany were deactivated for hate speech. Josh stated that he was glad Tumblr was finally doing something about the hate speech blogs, which in itself was the original point of Woody's Roundup.

The following day, YouTuber Philip DeFranco uploaded a video discussing Jones' arrest, which gathered upwards of 1.8 million views and 20,100 comments within 72 hours (shown below).  Released on Bail On June 15th, Jones was released from jail on a $100,000 bond with orders that he must abstain from using the internet while awaiting trial.[8] Guilty Plea On February 2nd, 2019, it was reported that Jones pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of child pornography. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 3rd and faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.[9] In his plea agreement, Jones \"acknowledged that he had conversations online with six teenage girls, ages 14 and 15, from 2010 to 2017.\" These interactions included requesting and encouraging 14- and 15-year-old girls to send him sexually explicit videos, including one instance where he claimed sending video would \"prove\" her fandom. According to the federal indictment,[10] Jones interacted with a 14-year-old girl, who explicitly stated her age, resulting in a charge of \"Production of Child Pornography.\" In their conversations, and through Jones's participation and encouragement, the videos produced videos of young women exposing their genitals. Sentencing In May 2019, it was reported that Jones was sentenced to 10 years in prison.[11] In his sentencing, district judge John Lee said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019d be an exaggeration to say the victims here were probably some of his biggest fans, who cared so much about him, and yet for whom Mr. Jones cared so little. I realize that you yourself suffered a great deal while you were growing up, and I\u2019m deeply sorry for the treatment you received from your own father, but Mr. Jones, you of all people should know the tremendous harm that you were causing these girls that you targeted and preyed upon when you were doing it.\u201d            Search Interest                External References  [1] Chicago Sun-Times \u2013 YouTube star Austin Jones charged with child porn counts in Chicago [2] La Times \u2013 Internet singer Austin Jones charged with felony child-pornography production [3] E!

Step 1: Open 8-Player Smash and move your controller (Can't be GamePad, if you use Gamecube controller it will be more complicated, use Wii or Pro Controller preferably). Step 2: Unsync your controller and tap an Amiibo to the GamePad. Step 3: Sync the controller back and move again. You should be on the second slot. Step 4: Repeat until 7 slots have an Amiibo (Do NOT tap an Amiibo to the eight slot or go out of the character select screen, otherwise glitch won't work). Step 5: After being in control of slot 8, go to the options menu and return. After that, 8 hands controlled by your controller should appear. Remove the Amiibos and select your character(s). Step 6: Select stage and start the battle. The exact thing that happened in the video should happen. NOTE: When you go out of the character selection screen, the glitch will end.

DAO Hard Fork In April 2016, the digital decentralized autonomous organization DAO launched, which used the Ethereum blockchain. On May 27th, The New York Times[3] reported about DAO security vulnerabilities discovered by a group of computer scientists, who claimed hackers could steal tokens collected by the DAO and recommended investors in the project hold off until the flaws were fixed. On June 9th, Blockchain Foundation founder Peter Vessenes published a blog post[4] about a \"recursive calls\" vulnerability allowing Ethereum smart contracts to be emptied. On June 17th, the DAO was confronted with several cyberattacks, including the recursive calls, leading one hacker to steal 3.6 million ether tokens valued at approximately $50 million USD. After the hack was publicized, the value of ether dropped from $21.50 to $8. On July 20th, Ethereum performed \"hard fork\" to reappropriate the stolen tokens, which led to a split in the network between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, though the latter is not supported by the Ethereum Foundation. The Flippening On June 12th, 2017, Ethereum peaked at $420 that morning, leading many to speculate that ether could overtake bitcoin in total market value in an event referred to as a \"flippening\". On June 13th, Motherboard[2] published an article titled \"Bitcoiners Are Freaking Out Over 'The Flippening',\" which reported that Ethereum had over five times as many nodes in their network and a larger number of transactions per day as Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Coindesk[5] published an article titled \"The #Flippening: Will Ether 'Pass' Bitcoin And What Would It Mean?\"                    Online Presence On July 30th, 2015, the Ethereum YouTube channel uploaded a video titled \"Ethereum: The World Computer,\" which speculated that the entire internet will \"use Ethereum\" in the future (shown below, left). On May 9th, 2016, the Genesis Mining YouTube channel uploaded a video showing the largest Ethereum mining facility, which gained over 1.1 million views within 13 months (shown below, right).

Also that day, The Atlantic[3] published an article titled \"When a Suspected Shooter's Facebook Page Becomes a Circus,\" reporting that Hodgkinson's Facebook had been swarmed with messages. Shortly after, the profile was removed from Facebook. That afternoon, police revealed that Hodgkinson died from his injuries.

For this reprehensible conduct, he should not be rewarded with a federal judgeship.\u201d[2]    In 1994, he won an election to be Alabama's Attorney General. During his tenure, he defended a school-funding model which was found unconstitutional for the way it discriminated against minorities in the state. He also defended the state in a case in which an LGBT group in Alabama sued the state for denying them funding. Sessions' argument was that the state should not fund  groups promoting illegal activities such as sodomy. In 1996, he won election to the United States Senate, where he served as Junior Senator from Alabama for 20 years. Attorney General After being a prominent Trump supporter in the 2016 United States Presidential Election, Sessions was nominated by Trump to serve as Attorney General. After a contentious confirmation process that saw many protests and Coretta Scott King's letter, Sessions was confirmed by a vote of 52-47 in the United States Senate. Russiagate Involvement In February 2017, the Justice Department claimed that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kiskylak on two occasions while Sessions was an adviser for the Trump campaign. This revelation contradicted Session's testimony during his Senate confirmation hearing, in which he stated that he no contact with Russian officials. On March 2nd, Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation into the Russian hacking. Sessions and his Deputy Rod Rosenstein both suggested that Trump fire James Comey, ostensibly to quell the Russiagate investigation. On June 6th, 2017, The New York Times[3] reported that Sessions had offered his resignation to Trump in recent weeks amid rising controversy surrounding Russiagate, but Trump declined. It is unclear as of June 12th whether Trump has confidence in Sessions. Sessions will publicly testify before the Senate Intel Committee on June 13th.[4] Russiagate Testimony On June 13th, Sessions testified publicly before the Senate and said that any allegations he helped the Trump campaign collude with Russia a \"detestable lie.\"[8] He also did not answer any questions about his conversations with Trump, citing vague legal reasons that conversations between the President and the Attorney General were to be kept confidential. However, Sessions could not point to specific Justice Department language to validate his reasoning. He also repeatedly stated he \"couldn't recall\" important details pertaining to the investigation, such as how many times he met with Sergey Kiskylak. Online, Twitter users followed the proceedings by making jokes about Sessions' appearance and demeanor, comparing him to Keebler Elves and Looney Toons character Foghorn Leghorn. These jokes were covered by Uproxx.[9]      Views on Marijuana Sessions is notoriously against the legalization of marijuana, saying the drug is \"only slightly less awful than heroin.\"[5] On May 12th, The New York Times[6] reported that Sessions had ordered federal prosecutors to pursue the maximum punishment in drug-related charges. Sessions' position led Smash Mouth to retweet Roger Stone's recommendation that Sessions stop watching Reefer Madness and let states decide on marijuana legalization (shown below, left).    Resignation On November 7th, 2018, it was reported that Donald Trump had asked Jeff Sessions to resign from his position as Attorney General. After his resignation, it was announced by Trump that Matthew Whitaker would be his replacement until a permanent replacement could be found, tweeting[10] \"We are pleased to announce that Matthew G. Whitaker, Chief of Staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice, will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States. He will serve our Country well\u2026\u2026..We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date.\"    In his resignation letter,[11] Sessions wrote that he \"worked to implement the law enforcement agenda based on the rule of law that formed a central part of your campaign for the presidency.\"        Online, people joked about the firing, commenting on the lack of a date on the resignation letter, his perceived likeness to the Keebler elves and more. Twitter[12] user @GMPaiella tweeted a photograph of Keebler cookies and the caption \"Fucked up that they're going to turn Jeff Sessions into one of these but what's done is done.\" Within 24 hours, the post received more than 120 likes and 665 retweets (shown below, left). Similarly, Twitter[13] user @allisona15 tweeted a picture of the Keebler elf with the caption, \"good news! now jeff sessions has more time for his other hobbies, like baking\" (shown below, center). New York Times writer David Itzkoff tweeted,[14] clues that that Sessions' resignation was long in the planning: -letter undated -refers to \"the new states of Arizona and New Mexico\" -congratulates Babe Ruth on 1st career home run -offers condolences to Lusitania victims  -stamp on envelope one of those upside-down airplanes.\" The tweet received more than 700 retweets and 5,900 likes in 24 hours.      After the installation of the new acting Attorney General, some expressed concern about the Mueller-Russia investigation, which could be in jeopardy. A MoveOn.org[15] event was created calling for \"MUELLER PROTECTION RAPID RESPONSE.\" The multi-state events calls on activists to protest the possible firing of Rod Rosenstein and dissolving of the Mueller investigation. The post states: Donald Trump has installed a crony to oversee the special counsel's Trump-Russia investigation, crossing a red line set to protect the investigation. By replacing Rod Rosenstein with just-named Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker as special counsel Robert Mueller's boss on the investigation, Trump has undercut the independence of the investigation. Whitaker has publicly outlined strategies to stifle the investigation and cannot be allowed to remain in charge of it. The Nobody Is Above the Law network demands that Whitaker immediately commit not to assume supervision of the investigation. Our hundreds of response events are being launched to demonstrate the public demand for action to correct this injustice. We will update this page as the situation develops. On November 8th, Redditor[16] Wadsworth_Constant_ asked about the protests in the /r/OutOfTheLoop subreddit \"I keep seeing links for this website. But I'm having a hard time understanding the context of investigation and its role in the bigger picture of American Politics? Didn't the US Democrats just win back the house?\" The post received more than 11,000 (83% upvoted) and 1,000 comments. Some outlets made reference to Sessions's positions on cannabis legislation. The Atlantic[17] reported that marijuana-related stocks spiked after news of Sessions's resignation. The Onion [18] wrote a mock article entitled \"Inconsolable Jeff Sessions Tries To Commit Suicide By Smoking Joint.\"                    Related Memes Jeff Sessions Retire Bitch After Sessions' March 2nd recusal from the Russiagate investigation, Twitter saw a surge of Retire Bitch tweets related to Sessions.    Nazi Keebler Elf Sessions' appearance and views on racist has caused Twitter users to popularly describe him as a \"Nazi Keebler Elf.\"[7] On June 12th, 2017, Eric Garland of the It's Time For Some Game Theory meme used the phrase to express excitement over Sessions' upcoming testimony, gaining over 280 retweets (shown below).

Milkshake duck stood out as being a much needed term to describe something we are seeing more and more of, not just on the internet but now across all types of media. It plays to the simultaneous desire to bring someone down and the hope that they won\u2019t be brought down. In many ways it captures what 2017 has been about.

On October 27th, 2020, after previously stating that no delays should be expected, CD Projekt Red announced the third delay, moving the release date to December 10th, 2020 (message shown below).    The third delay prompted a series of memes in the form of Cyberpunk 2077 Delay Message Parodies which used  the signature yellow message background for humorous purposes. Release On December 10th, 2020, Cyberpunk 2077 released globally.                     Online Presence In September 2012, the @CyberpunkGame[5] Twitter feed was created. On October 17th, a Facebook[4] page for the game was launched, which gathered upwards of 137,000 likes over the next five years. On January 12th, 2013, the Cyberpunk 2077 Wiki was launched.[7] The official website for the game is hosted by CD Projekt RED at Cyberpunk.net.[3]                    Fandom On October 18th, 2012, the /r/cyberpunk2077[1] subreddit was launched for discussions about the game.

Within 48 hours, the tweet gained over 2,300 likes and 550 retweets.   cw nsfwHow is this not on my timeline right now, is this real pic.twitter.com/XzCWHH6rhu\u2014 avery \u2615\ufe0f (@neondreamgirl) June 11, 2019      Some criticized the ad for being hypersexualized and fetishizing trans people. The following day, the video game news site Polygon[11] published an interview with the Cyberpunk 2077 art director Kasia Redesiuk about the ad:  Polygon: Why was a trans model used in this advertisement? Redesiuk: Personally, for me, this person is sexy. I like how this person looks. However, this model is used -- their beautiful body is used -- for corporate reasons. They are displayed there just as a thing, and that\u2019s the terrible part of it.  Additionally, Redesiuk stated that the game is set in a dystopian future, and the ad is emblematic of the aggressive advertisements of an era where \"megacorporations dictate everything\" and stated \"it was never the intention to offend anyone\" when asked how she would respond to criticisms of the ad. Seizure Controversy On December 7th, 2020, Game Informer[12] posted a PSA about potential epileptic triggers seen in Cyberpunk 2077. On that day, Game Informer tweeted the link to the article, with the post gaining over 4,400 retweets and 9,700 likes (tweet shown below, left). On December 7th, Liana Ruppert (@DirtyEffinHippy), the author of the article, made a tweet[13] about experiencing a seizure episode while playing the game (tweet shown below, center). On December 8th, Ruppert tweeted[14] that she had been receiving videos containing photosensitive triggers under the guise of support messages.      In the following days, multiple video game outlets reported  about the potential triggers in the game and that as of version 1.00 Cyberpunk 2077 did not have a seizure warning splash screen apart from a warning included in the user license agreement. On December 8th, a CDPR representative told IGN[15] that the studio was working to add such a warning screen. Following the viral discussion of the topic on Twitter, memes about Cyberpunk 2077 containing potential seizure triggers gained popularity online, particularly in /r/gamingcirclejerk subreddit (examples shown below).

A stronger conservative majority seemed likely as opinion polls at the time showed May with as much as a 20 point lead over her opposition. Major issues discussed in the campaign were Brexit, national security, and social care. May campaigned on generating support Brexit and lower domestic taxes while Corbyn campaigned on public spending and that services such as education were being underfunded.                    Developments Hours after May called the snap election, Corbyn, Sturdgeon of the SNP party, and Tim Farron of the Liberal Democrats all called for televised debates. May opposed any televised debates, but the BBC announced they would host debates to be held on May 31st and June 6th, whether or not May attended. Labour ruled out Corbyn attending if May did not attend, but on May 31st, Corbyn did appear at the debate, while the conservatives sent Home Secretary Amber Rudd. Meanwhile, Corbyn and the Labour Party gained significantly in the polls, cutting the Conservative Party's 20 point lead to about 6 points.    Terrorist Attacks During the campaign, two terrorist attacks occurred in England that shifted the focus of the campaign to national security. After the 2017 Manchester Bombing, both parties ceased campaigning for three days. Labour criticized May for her cuts to the police force and her foreign policy as reasons that led to the attack. Conservatives stated that spending on counter-terrorism measures had increased. The campaigns were postponed a second time following the 2017 London Attack. After that attack, May proposed increased restriction on the internet and a global effort to tackle Islamist ideology. Results On June 8th, the Labour Party performed much better than most expected, gaining 29 seats for a total of 261. The Conservatives, meanwhile, lost 13 seats, and while they still had a majority, they lost their absolute majority, resulting in a hung parliament. It is expected that the Conservatives will attempt to align with the Democratic Unionist Party to form a coalition government.[2]                    Related Memes Lord Buckethead Lord Buckethead was a joke candidate for the Maidenhead constituency, that of Theresa May, during the election.[3] Lord Buckethead appeared in black robes with a giant black helmet and campaigned on \"strong but not entirely stable leadership,\" a mock at the Conservative Party's slogan, \"Strong and Stable.\" Lord Buckethead had also run against Margaret Thatcher and John Major in 1987 and 1992, respectively. Buckethead gained 249 votes, the most he had ever received.    At May's speech in Maidenhead following the election, Lord Buckethead stood on the stage with the other candidates from the constituency, which included Elmo.

One night, they read a pop-up book called The Babadook, which has mysteriously appeared in their house. The book tells the story of Mister Babadook, a tall man in black with a top hat who, once let in, cannot be eradicated until he kills the host. Amelia is disturbed by the graphic story and Samuel becomes convinced the monster is real. As the story unfolds, Amelia grows increasingly manic as she is unable to tell what is real and what isn't, and is perhaps becoming infested with the Babadook.                     Development The film was Kent's first full-length film and was produced on a budget of $2.5 million. It was shot in Adelaide, Australia and interior shots were mostly filmed in a soundstage. A Victorian terrace house was built specifically for the film. It premiered in January of 2014 at the Sundance Film Festival and had a limited run in Australia that year, premiering in just 13 theaters. It initially opened in only 3 theaters in the United States. However, following positive critical reception, it was able to grow to a massive success.                    Reception The film was very positively reviewed, with a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes[2] and an 86 rating on Metacritic.[3] Critics praised the film's moving story and commitment to horror without jump scares, as well as the performances from the two leads. Fandom Fan reception to the film has been strong as well. On Facebook,[4] The Babadook has over 160,000 likes. There is also a large amount of fan art on DeviantArt devoted to The Babadook.[5] One notable instance of Babadook fandom was posted to Twitter on June 30th, 2016, when writer Katie Dippold tweeted about a Halloween party she attended dressed as the Babadook only to discover it wasn't a costume party (shown below). Her tweet gained over 76,000 retweets and 146,000 likes and was covered by New York Magazine.[6]    Gay Icon In early 2017, a joke that The Babadook was gay began spreading through Tumblr and eventually Twitter. On December 10th, 2016, Tumblr user Taco-bell-rey[7] uploaded a screenshot of The Babadook appearing in the LGBT section of Netflix. The post gained over 126,000 notes, and likely launched the idea that The Babadook was a gay character and icon.    The idea continued to spread throughout Tumblr as ironic, trolling discourse. On February 15th, 2017, Twitter user @Broderick[8] uploaded screenshots of such dialogue, gaining over 5,000 retweets (shown below).    The meme drew its most attention when June, LGBT Pride Month, began. Then, the jokes about Babadook's gay identity spread with such fervor they were covered by Mashable[9] and Teen Vogue[10] (examples shown below). As of June 7th, much of the Tumblr[11] discourse around the Babadook centers around him being a gay icon.      Why Can't You Just Be Normal? Why Can't You Just Be Normal? refers to a scene from the film in which the protagonist turns to her son in her car and cries \"Why can't you just be normal?\", leading the child to respond by shrieking. The scene became an exploitable where the characters are labeled as different objects.    Limited Edition Pride Blu-Ray On June 3rd, 2019, IFC Midnight[12] tweeted: \"To celebrate #PrideMonth, we\u2019ve teamed up with @ShoutFactory for a limited edition of THE BABADOOK. Even better than this? A portion of all sales in June go to the @LALGBTCenter. So yeah, we're the screaming kid right now and we're not sorry!\" (shown below). The tweet garnered over 500 likes in a day. The limited edition blu-ray has a a rainbow color.    That same day, Twitter user @Keviatha[13] responded by posting a Mr. Krabs meme about companies using rainbow colors to capitalize on Pride month (shown below, left). The tweet accumulated 50 likes in a day. The next day, @MeownTown[14] responded to the blu-ray announcement by tweeting, \"the babadook being gay is an lgbt+ joke, i'm personally really glad the creators of the movie are acknowledging a meme that us queers made. maybe it's capitalism, but it's hilarious capitalism.\" The tweet gained over 40 likes that day (shown below, right).

There, he acquired over 5 million followers before the app went defunct (compilation shown below).[1]  On March 27th, 2014, Paul uploaded a compilation of his Vines to YouTube,[2] marking his first video on the site. There, several of his videos racked up millions of views with clickbait titles such as \"SHE'S NAKED?!\" and \"SEXY KILLER CLOWN ATTACKS US (not a joke).\"     Bizaardvark On March 9th, 2016, it was announced that Paul was cast in the Disney Channel original series Bizaardvark as the character Dirk.[3] Dirk is the star of a show within the show called Dare Me Bro, where he performs crazy dares, not unlike his Vine and YouTube personalities.  On July 22nd, Disney Channel and Jake Paul mutually decided to part ways,[8] with Paul leaving his Disney Channel series Bizaardvark mid-way through the second season. In a statement,[12] a Disney spokesman said:  \"We\u2019ve mutually agreed that Jake Paul will leave his role on the Disney Channel series \u2018Bizaardvark.\u2019 On behalf of the production company, the cast and crew, we thank Jake for his good work on the TV series for the past 18 months and extend our best wishes to him.\"  That day, Paul also released a statement via Twitter[9].

White House Breach On January 5th, 2017, Paul hid in the bathroom of The White House and stayed there for several hours, leaving in the early morning unnoticed. He posted a video about the stunt (shown below, left). This caused the Secret Service to visit his house after that, which he also posted a video about (shown below, right), though they deemed him a non-threat.     It's Everyday Bro On May 30th, 2017, Paul uploaded a music video for a song called \"It's Everyday Bro\" to YouTube, where it gained over 26 million views (shown below). In the video, he brags about his followers and stated that he would soon pass Pewdiepie. Furthermore he made reference to his ex-girlfriend Alissa Violet, another YouTube star, who had undergone a very public breakup a few months prior amid rumors of mutual cheating and that Violet had begun to date Jake's brother, Logan Paul.[4]  The video soon generated drama between all the involved parties. Following the release of the video, Logan responded by essentially laughing it off in a video (shown below, top left). Then Jake uploaded a diss track directed to his brother (shown below, top right). This continued to escalate as fans of both started to feud with each other, leading Jake to release an apology video (shown below, bottom left). Logan then responded with another, jokey diss track, but couched within it a vlog in which he said he would give Jake a second chance (shown below, bottom right). Two threads about the entire drama were posted to /r/OutOfTheLoop.[5][6]       Meanwhile, Pewdiepie responded to Jake Paul's diss in \"It's Everyday Bro\" by mocking the video point by point in a video of his own that gathered over 6 million views (shown below).

He would actually shove me. \u2026 He would just do it way too hard.\"  [\u2026]  \"I want to clear the air. He\u2019s not a physical abuser.

Telegram launched 16 months later in August 2013.[1] The idea behind the company is to make privacy and security, not profits, the number one goal, something Telegram's founders sees lacking in companies like Google or Facebook.[4]", "other_text": "Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce Vinny Sexual Misconduct Allegations        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       History In February 2012, Nikolai and Pavel Durov, the founders of Russia's largest social networking site VK, began developing Telegram, an end-to-end encrypted instant messaging service. Telegram launched 16 months later in August 2013.[1] The idea behind the company is to make privacy and security, not profits, the number one goal, something Telegram's founders sees lacking in companies like Google or Facebook.[4]                    Features Telegram contains many of the same features that other instant messaging clients provide, such as accessing people worldwide over the internet, rather than through SMS, as well as the ability to synchronize across devices. The system also allows for group messaging of up to 5,000 members and the ability to send any type of document. Security The most important and noteworthy feature of Telegram is its security. Telegram offers two layers of encryption: Server-client encryption and client-client encryption. This is all based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie\u2013Hellman secure key exchange. The company is so confident in its encryption that it's offering $300,000 to anyone who can crack it.[2] Telegram also has a feature called \"Secret Chat,\" which offers end-to-end encryption. Therefore, those in the secret chats are the only ones who can read the messages. Messages sent in Secret Chats cannot be forwarded, and when they are deleted from one side of the exchange, the other side is automatically deleted as well. Secret Chats also offer self-destructing messages, meaning that the user can place a timer on the message, timing it delete after being sent. As soon as the timer runs out, the message disappears from both devices.                    Highlights Usage By Terrorists Due to the heavy security features on Telegram, the app has been popular among members of the Islamic State. Telegram has become the application of choice for ISIS when it comes to planning and broadcasting, giving them a safe and secure way to record and share videos throughout the world.[3] Telegram, known for their minimal interference, has yet to take aggressive action against these groups, unlike their competitors. For the most part, Telegram does not feel responsible for what people do with their technology. On November 17th, 2015, two days after the 2015 Paris Terrorist Attack, Telegram-founder Pavel Durov posted a picture of himself with the Eiffel Tower in the background.[5] As of June 2017, the post as received more than 26,000 likes. In the caption he wrote:  I join all those who mourn deaths in the most beautiful city of the world.  I think the French government is as responsible as ISIS for this, because it is their policies and carelessness which eventually led to the tragedy. They take money away from hardworking people of France with outrageously high taxes and spend them on waging useless wars in the Middle East and on creating parasitic social paradise for North African immigrants. It is a disgrace to see Paris in the hands of shortsighted socialists who ruin this beautiful place. I hope they and their policies go away forever and this city will once again shine in its full glory \u2013 safe, rich and beautiful.  Vive la France! \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7     Lawmakers inside the United States government have urged the service to take action against terrorist groups and to aide governments fighting them. In winter 2015, the House Foreign Affairs Committee sent a letter to Durov urging him to block content by ISIS. Signed by Texas Republican Representative Ted Poe and California Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, the letter said, \"No private company should allow its services to be used to promote terrorism and plan out attacks that spill innocent blood.\" Ban in Russia On March 20th, 2018, in accordance with a 2016 law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Telegram was ordered by the Russian Supreme Court to share user data with the Russian Federal Security Services (F.S.B.).[6] The agency believes that it needs access to the app to properly protect the country from terrorist attacks. Following their loss, Telegram said that they would appeal the decision. After the company refused to hand over user data, the Russian government's watchdog agency filed a lawsuit against the messaging app on April 6th. The lawsuit would limit access to the messenger if they did not hand over the decrypted data.[7] The following week, on April 13th, a Russia court ruled that Telegram be blocked immediately for failing to comply with a court ruling.[9] The hearing took 18 minutes.[9][10] That day, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov posted on the site,[8] \"At Telegram, we have the luxury of not caring about revenue streams or ad sales. Privacy is not for sale, and human rights should not be compromised out of fear or greed.\" The post (shown below) received more than 815,000 views in one week.    Five days later, the head of the watchdog agency Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov, said that in attempt to block the website it had obstructed millions of IP address. According to the New York Times,[11] Telegram moved to American web hosts, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services and repeated changed its IP address to circumvent the block. The move caused a blackout for numerous websites including the messaging app Viber and Volvo dealerships. Ban in Iran On April 18th, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced that they would be leaving the app. Many believe that the exit signals that the app would be banned in Iran, similar to Russia.[12] Nearly half the country's population, about 40 million Iranians, use Telegram.

Metaphors of Disaster: Hackers from NCL Productions on Vimeo.  Shortly after, the group was hacked and the members founded a new group knowns \"StarWarsSithpostingOriginal.\" Before the second hack, the group had more than 189,000 members. After the second hacking, it became the primary group and has 70,000 members as of mid-November 2017. After Caine's Coup, yet another sister group \"The Confederacy Of Independent Sithposters,\" which has garnered more than 6,200 members as of March 2018.[3] Following the hack, many prominent members of the community had been banned by the hackers and the admins attempted to sort through who was banned unfairly and who had been banned before the hacking. Meanwhile, Revenge Of The Sithposters had created an entire subculture within the group. The group, for a time, changed the name from Revenge Of The Sithposters  to \"Sithposting Presents: Spaceposting.\" The idea was that the group wouldn't directly compete with the main page, but would rather be a spin-off group that posted memes about all kinds of Sci-fi films. Hardly any non-Star Wars memes were made. A separate group made primarily to continue in the spirit of the original Sithposting group started a new group called StarWarsSithPostingOriginal.[4] Second Hack In May 2017, Sithposting was hacked by another phishing scam, which removed all mods and added new ones. The real admins and their supporters moved back to \"Spaceposting,\" which was rebranded as \"Star Wars Sithposting: A New Hope\"[5] to attract the original fanbase. Unlike with the previous hacking, this one seems permanent. Facebook has repeatedly denied the admins' claims that the group was hacked and at this point. Numerous attempts have been made to get Facebook to delete the page, but as of January 2018, none of the plans have worked. On July 25th, a video that dramatized the hack was uploaded to Vimeo. [5] The second installment of Metaphors Of Disaster, \"Cyber Warfare.\" The video (shown below) received more than 600 views as of March 2018.   Metaphors of Disaster: Cyber Warfare from NCL Productions on Vimeo.   The Hackers Sell The Original Group During 2017, the hackers sold the page to a group of Facebook users who were attempting to sell counterfit luxury cars. The original users of Sithposting contacted Mercedes about the group and Facebook banned the group.                    Related Memes Gyrosposting Gyrosposting is a form of shitposting that could be compared to a Shaggy Dog Story, a joke defined by how long and rambling it is. On the surface, the joke is about the gyro kebab's stereotypical ability to cause diarrhea, but the main comedic appeal is making a long drawn-out story that vaguely connects to a Star Wars quote at the end. This meta-meme originated shortly after the first hacking when moderator Aldo Roemer van Opdorp abused his mod privileges to post memes that had increasingly more to do with Gyros and less to do with Star Wars. This meme format has many various recurring aspects, including a place called Babi's Kebabs, dine-and-dashing, having an instant stream of diarrhea that is sometimes powerful enough to propel the person who is affected by it, Imodium (a drug that is known for stopping diarrhea) and more (examples below).     Metaphors Of Disaster Metaphors of Disaster are a series of feature-length videos in which members of the group have their faces cut out and pasted onto various movie clips to dramatize the various hacks of the group. These clips are then strung together in order to tell a story. A third film, \"Metaphors Of Disaster: Saving Private Massoud\" is currently in the works. Massoud Boulassel Massoud Boulassel is a popular character in the Sithposting community (shown below). It is based on a man who joined the group, despite not having much interest in Star Wars shitposting.    Hello With Friends \"Hello With Friends\" is now a popular inside joke in the group. Perhaps one of the greater tragedies of Sithposting, even sadder than the hacking, occurred when members of the group accidentally scared Massoud off. While the vast majority of the group was excited to have him around, a small group of people mocked his broken English and bizarre mannerisms. Massoud disappeared from the group and has been nearly impossible to find since. For almost a full year now, members of the Sithposting community have been trying to find this octogenarian living meme and let him know just how much they love him. Pant Posting While there is much dispute over who officially started the Ben Swolo and \"The Last Jedi Spoiler But With No Context\" Memes, the ancestor of both memes was a short-lived trend known as \"Pant-Posting.\" In a private Facebook chat, the mods and admins who had managed to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi early discussed what moments they thought would produce quality memes. Instead of images from the film, a short trend of putting pants on animals became a short-lived trend.    Mouse Droids > Gonk Droids Mouse Droids > Gonk Droids is a debate to two different droids in the Star Wars films, a small droid on wheels known as the \"Mouse Droid\" and a larger, square walking droid knowns as the \"Gonk Droid.\" One mod named Austin Allan started the debate knowns as \"Mouse Droids > Gonk Droids.\"      BuzzFeed Raid On January 1st, 2018 Buzzfeed released an article titled \"In Case Shirtless Kylo Ren Wasn't Enough For You, There's Now The \"#KyloRenChallenge\":memes/kylorenchallenge.\" In response to this, Sithposters organized an event called Buzzfeed Raid: Page's Closed [7] in retaliation. During this event, participants would wait until Buzzfeed posted a new article and then spam the comments with a close-up image of Finn with the caption \"this page is closed for sanitation\" (examples below).

As of June 5th, 2017, the music video (shown below) has over 205 million views.                     Spread The song quickly became an ubiquitous hit. Many were quick to point out the group sounded much like the band The Postal Service, which had scored a hit with the similar-sounding \"Such Great Heights\" prior to the release of \"Fireflies.\" Vulture[2] wrote an article listing Owl City's numerous similarities to The Postal Service on March 30th, 2010. On November 30th, YouTube user will able uploaded a remix of the song where all the notes of the song were replaced by sounds made by dogs and cats, gathering over 272,000 views (shown below).  The song also was referenced in numerous memes popular at the time, appearing in numerous advice animals and rage comics (examples shown below).      In the following years, the song's online presence consisted mostly of appearing in ear rape remixes (examples shown below).     2017 Comeback In late May and early June of 2017, the song began to appear in \"Unfitting Music\" videos on Instagram, some popular examples of which were then posted to iFunny. On May 27th, Instagram user _slendersphere[4] posted a version of an alien popping out of a person's chest then beginning to sing \"Fireflies,\" gaining over 134,000 views (shown below, left). On May 30th, Instagram user Labrynthske[3] posted a video of a man dressed as the character Woody from Toy Story dancing while \"Fireflies\" played in the background (YouTube embed shown below, right). This video was later reposted to iFunny,[5] where it gained over 94,000 likes.     Threads inquiring about the sudden resurgence in \"Fireflies\" memes were posted to /r/OutOfTheLoop[6] and /r/OwlCity.[7] On May 30th, Twitter user @Pryce_D reached out to Owl City asking them about the song in a series of tweets. The first tweet (shown below, left) said, \"In the song 'Fireflies' you state 'I get a thousand hugs from 10,000 lightning bugs.' How do you interpret this statement?\" The tweet received more than 1,200 retweets and 2,900 likes. @Pryce_D quickly followed up with a second tweet (shown below, right), writing, \"In the song 'Fireflies' you state \"I get a thousand hugs from 10,000 lightning bugs.\" How do you interpret this statement?\"[8][9]     Roughly three weeks later, Owl City responded on Facebook, garnering more than 78,000 reactions, 29,000 shares and 15,000 comments.[10] They wrote:  Pryce -- great question. I was the recipient of 1,000 hugs from 10,000 lightning bugs for a grand total of 10,000,000 hugs. As the lyrics of the song clearly state, the average layperson would not believe their eyes if 10,000,000 fireflies were to illuminate planet Earth, nor would the average person conclude by natural instinct that 10,000 lightning bugs, acting as a collective group, are capable of embracing a human being 1,000 times without difficulty. By the same token, a gathering of lightning bugs in such vast numbers form a sort of \u201cswarm,\" and a swarm can collectively surround a human and deliver a \u201chug\u201d that a single firefly, acting according to the dictates of his own conscience, simply cannot. Consequently, I was embraced 1,000 times by 10,000 luminescent insects.   This may seem inconceivable due to the firefly\u2019s soft-shelled body, which is common among all winged beetles within the Lampyridae insect family. Members of the scientific community may be tempted to cast doubt upon the possibility of this exchange due to the immobility of the prothorax and pterothorax, in addition to the elytra protruding outward while a firefly is engaged in mid-flight. However, I can testify to the accuracy of this exchange. I can furthermore add that while each individual hug took place, each firefly participated in the chemical reaction commonly known as bioluminescence in which the enzymes within the firefly, in the presence of oxygen, magnesium ions and ATP, emitted a chemically produced light or \u201cglow\u201d because they were happy to be hugging me.   Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out with any further questions. Stream \u201cFireflies\u201d on Apple Music and Spotify.     Several news outlets covered Owl City's response, including TIME,[11] The Verge,[12] NME,[13] Mashable[14] and more.

Other characters/segments include Rita and Runt (the former of whom was voiced by Bernadette Peters), Slappy The Squirrel (based on actual vintage cartoon character Screwy Squirrel), Pinky and the Brain (whose series later became a spin-off show of its own) and more.

There were 69 episodes produced during this run. The series then was picked up by Kids WB, where it ran until its final, 99th episode. The series was discontinued after Warner Brothers began to invest in less-expensive series such as Pok\u00e9mon. Several series succeeded Animaniacs, including Pinky & The Brain and Freakazoid though neither achieved the same level of success during their original runs. A direct-to-video film, Wakko's Wish, was released on December 21st, 1999, serving as a closure to the series. Reboot As of May 30th, 2017 an announcement has been made that a reboot of the series is coming in the future in response to the show's popularity on Netflix and the mid 2010s wave of 90s nostalgia. It has also been reported that Steven Spielberg will also come back to work on the reboot.[3] On October 21st, 2020, subscription video on demand service Hulu released a trailer for upcoming reboot of the show.[4][5] The trailer (shown below) received over 350,000 views on Twitter and 160,000 views on YouTube in three hours. The premiere of the new series is scheduled for November 20th, 2020.                     Reception Animaniacs was very well-received during its run. It won eight Daytime Emmy Awards and one Peabody Award. Not only was it popular with kids, but the adult fandom created one of the earliest online Fandoms. Since its run, Animaniacs been highly praised by many people who watched it while growing up and have since found even greater appreciation for it as adults, most notably Doug Walker who has produced, among other tributes, a multi-part retrospective video featuring interviews with several of the actual personnel involved in its creation.

The Genderless Child  I'm a genderless child, not a giraffe. (Frisk, If Undertale Was Realistic)  One of the running gags from the series was that Frisk was a genderless child (as hinted at in the game itself), constantly reminding people of this and even becoming triggered at one point when offered the choice between a blue and pink umbrella, which they assume is based on gender. This has become an inside joke for Undertale fans who have seen the animation. This is also sometimes used with \"I'm not a giraffe\", in reference to the full quote.                    Am I Right Lads or Am I Right Lads?  Am I right lads or am I right lads? (Frisk, If Undertale Was Realistic)  Another running gag was that at certain points, Frisk would say \"am I right lads or am I right lads?\" and a lego minifigure would run into the scene and say \"you are right, lad!\" possibly to reference Frisk's non-racial yellow skin tone. For example, in episode 6 the minifigure comes into the scene late and Frisk warns them to come on time. Then in episode 7, the minifigure comes early and cuts off Frisk's statement, and Frisk scolds them by calling them \"the worst kind of lad\".

Far Cry 5 On May 26th, 2017, Ubisoft announced Far Cry 5, which, for the first time, brought players to America. Set in Hope County, Montana, the game pits players in a violent war against a cult who seeks to take over the area.[4] The game is set for a released date of February 27th, 2018. That day, Ubisoft released the first trailer for the game. WIthin 12 hours, the video (shown below) has been viewed 440,000. The trailer was also posted to the subreddits /r/gaming,[5] /r/pcgaming[6] and /r/xboxone,[7] where it received more than 1,000 points each, respectively, in the first 12 hours.

Far Cry 6  On July 10th, 2020, Twitter[24] user @anjonh0422 reported that Far Cry 6 release date, cover art and additional information were leaked due to the game being accidentally listed in PlayStation Store Hong Kong.[25] On the store page, the game was scheduled for a February 18th, 2021, release. The game will take place on an island of Yara, \"a tropical paradise frozen in time.\" The main villain of the game dictator Anton Castillo is portrayed by actor Giancarlo Esposito.

Reception The main entries in the series have generally fared well with critics and players. The first Far Cry game scored 89% on Metacritic,[3] while its successors have generally scored in that range, between 85% and 90%.  Far Cry 5 Release and Reception On March 27th, 2018, Far Cry 5 was released. Regarding the controversy surrounding its main antagonists, both Polygon[21] and Select All[22] commented with disappointment that the game ended up not taking any hard political stances, which caused Polygon to opine Far Cry 5 doesn\u2019t want to offend anyone, so it will end up annoying everyone, and Select All to call the game's vision of rural America \"toothless.\" However, many of the reviews of the game ended up being positive. On Metacritic,[23] the game received a rating of 81/100, with some critics praising it as the best game in the series, with praise given to the open world, content, and story.                    Fandom and Criticisms Vaas Montenegro Vaas Montenegro is the secondary antagonist of Far Cry 3. Vaas has been a popular subject of memes online due to the quirks of his character and his memorable \"Definition of Insanity\" monologue.   Far Cry 5 Antagonist On May 26th, 2017, people discussed the game's new locale and villains, commenting that this would be the first time a Far Cry game took place in America. Some on Twitter discussed Ubisoft's decision to make rural Americans the antagonist in the game. That day, Twitter user @Spacekatgal[8] wrote, \"I played and enjoyed Far Cry when it had unsettling right-wing themes, and I'll play this one too. But, wow, they really went there.\" Another user, @patrickklepek[9] tweeted, \"I don't know anything about Far Cry 5, but a game about white identity and extreme nationalism would be awfully appropriate in 2017.\"     Twitter published a Moments page[11] to document the reaction to the announcement. Several news outlets covered the announcement as well, including Polygon,[10] Kotaku,[12] Forbes[13] and more That day, Redditor wolfram[14] posted a photo of himself made to look like the antagonist from Far Cry 5 in the thread \"I didn't realize I was cast as the villain for Far Cry 5.\" The post (shown below) received more than 50,000 points (60% upvoted) and 2,200 comments.    White Genocide Controversy That day, more reactions to the trailer, particularly its use of a white, Christian cult as the antagonist, caused some online to call the game a \"white genocide simulator.\" An anonymous 4chan user created the thread \"Far Cry 'White Genocide Simulator 5'\" and wrote \"From a purely business standpoint, I don't understand what their strategy is here. In my experience most gamers are white and seem to be more right-leaning than left. How does alienating the majority of their prospective buyer base seem like a good idea? Do they honestly think this will sell well, or are they just doing it anyway because it's 'the right narrative?'\"[18] The thread received more than 575 replies before archiving. Since the trailer's release, an online petition on the website Change.org[19] started, asking Ubisoft to \"Cancel Far Cry 5.\" The author of the petition writes, \"Enough is enough UbiSoft.

But no more!  Far Cry 5 is an insult to your fanbase, the Americans who make up the majority of your customers, and it\u2019s time you woke up to that fact.  Change this, or cancel it.\" As of May 30th, the petition has more than 680 signatures, roughly 300 short of its goal. However, many have wondered if this is a real controversy or an example of Poe's Law, in which the controversy itself is a satire. Redditor FindMeTheTruth[20] posted about the petition in the /r/KotakuInAction subreddit under the thread \"SJW's have been faking outrage by 'white supremacists', possibly Ubisoft themselves as Ghostbusters tier marketing, for the upcoming Far Cry game. Problem is that they forgot to word things so it doesn't sound like them (includes blaming Gamergate for attacking gamers).\" The post received more than 1,000 points (77% upvoted) and 150 comments. Twitter users have also said that they were skeptical as to whether this was an actual outrage or not.                        Fandom On August 22nd, 2016, the /r/farcry[15] subreddit launched. In nine months, it has gained more than 12,800 subscribers.

Spread The spread of jokes about the scene coincided with the rise of Prequel Memes in late 2015. Of these, two formats were most prominent: either the scene was referenced in an existing meme template (example shown below, left), or the scene itself was turned into an exploitable (example shown below, right).     The scene has continued to be referenced in jokes throughout mostly Reddit in recent years.

Though the site has since been cleansed of the posts, it can still be accessed via web.archive.[7] According to New York Magazine,[3] the hack most likely came from Harvard's satirical publication, The Harvard Lampoon. The moment was covered by Daily Dot,[4] The Verge,[5] and Business Insider.[6]    Twitter Jokes On Twitter, users joked about the speech by mocking the men sitting behind Zuckerberg, who were dressed in top hats and suits, for looking like aristocrats from the early 20th century.

The feed is operated by the Dutch  software company Archie, who initially placed the webcam there to test if their systems worked properly (shown below).[1] On May 28th, 2015, Dutch entertainment website GeenStijl wrote an article after their discovery of the webcam,[2] in which they promoted people to start a flash mob on the roundabout in the style of the Project X events.                     Notable Developments Following the spread of GeenStijl's article, the roundabout gained notable attention throughout the country. The video reached over 50,000 views by June 1st, and had surpassed 250,000 views by June 4th. GeenStijl was also rewarded with champagne by Archie after the video surpasses 50,000 views during their shooting of a video on the roundabout (shown below). Various Dutch news outlets reported the sudden increase in views on the roundabout, including the NOS[7] and Nieuws.nl.[8]  The Flash Mob A Facebook page titled \"Flashmop de rotonde Purmerend\"[3] (Flashmop the roundabout Purmerend) was launched which tried to organise a flashmob event by having participants do a polonaise around the roundabout. After around 150 people signed up for the event, Purmerend's city council decided to cancel the event due to traffic safety[9] (shown below) and Archie would shut down the webcam.[10] The flashmob and the reaction was covered by various Dutch news outlets, such as Algemeen Dagblad[4] and RTVNH.[5][6] The Facebook page of the event was deleted shortly after and the webcam later went back online.    \"No flashmob on roundabout. Due to traffic safety a flashmob on the roundabout will be disallowed.\"    Reddit Rediscovery On July 14th, 2015, a post on the r/videos sub-Reddit[11] notified the site's community about the roundabout's lifestream. Following the post, a Purmerend citizen who goes by the Reddit handle SomeoneOutThere_ replied to the post[12] and was subsequently challenged to appear on the webcam (shown below). Within a day, the video of the SomeoneOutThere_'s appearance on the webcam managed to gather over 45,000 views and his reply became the top voted reply with over 14,000 points.  Following SomeoneOutThere_'s appearance on the webcam, that same day various other Redditors used the opportunity to also appear on the webcam. In the following 24 hours, various messages were written on the roundabout, including \"OP = Faggot\" and \"Reddit = 4 Fags\",[13] by Redditors and outsiders. Redditor Damindenie also made a reply to the post with hyperlinks to pictures of various events that took place on the roundabout throughout the day.[14] Another Redditor, who goes by the Youtube handle Slechte TV,[15][16] also drew an image of Dick Butt on the roundabout alongside Ellen Pao's name and a website URL. Redditor Johan-Senpai also appeared dressed in a witch outfit (shown below, left), and other Redditors later appeared to clean off the website url after Redditors complained about the website presumably hijacking the roundabout (shown below, right). Eventually that night police started to patrol around the roundabout, after which activity died down. Archie respectively took down the webcam, although it was already back up again the next day.     At its peaks, the livestream counted over 4,000 viewers during the events. A sub-Reddit dedicated to the roundabout, r/otonde,[17] was also launched on July 14th, which managed to gather over 60 subscribers within 24 hours. Dutch news outlets also covered the events that took place on the roundabout, including Algemeen Dagblad,[18] The Telegraaf,[19] Metro[20] and PowNed.[21] Outside of The Netherlands, the events were also documented on TheNextWeb.[23] On July 15th, a Reddit livefeed was also created which documented the events taking place on the roundabout.[22] Later that day, a website dedicated to the roundabout was also launched.[24] On /b/ Following the rising popularity of the roundabout on Reddit, 4chan's /b/ (random) board also gained an interest in the webcam. On July 16th, multiple threads appeared on the board to discuss events that could take place. Because /b/ doesn't archive its threads, the events combined with local times can also be found on the Reddit livefeed.[22] A bit prior to 5 pm (local time), a /b/ user appeared on the roundabout wearing a paper crown with \"/b/\" written on it (shown below), and was later joined by another /b/ user who created a newfag triforce using the road markings.  Shortly prior to 10 pm (local time), another /b/ user started to spread oatmeal across the roundabout (shown below, left), gaining him the nickname oatmeal guy. City enforcement arrived at the scene a few minutes after, taking oatmeal guy with them and later forcing him to clean up his own work. Following the arrest and the cleanup, /b/ users showed their respect to the man, claiming he \"dindu nuffin\", and started posting tweets with the hashtag #FreeOatmealGuy (shown below, right). Archie later took down the webcam around midnight, after being requested by the police, and put it back online the next day.

In December 1996, the software company Macromedia purchased FutureSplash, renaming the product to Adobe Flash and releasing it as both an editor and player. The new version was widely adopted on the web by video game and animation creators following the release of a free browser plugin. HTML 5 In January 2008, the core technology Internet markup language HTML 5 was released, which included several features similar to Adobe Flash, including audio and video playback and Scalable Vector Graphics. Unlike Flash, HTML 5 requires the use of CSS3 and Javascript to run animations and interactive elements. In January 2015, YouTube replaced Flash with HTML 5 as their default video player.                    Highlights Newgrounds In 1995, the first version of the site Newgrounds was launched, which has been cited as the web's oldest Flash animation portal user-generated community. The site was scarcely updated until after the Macromedia acquisition of Flash in 1996. YTMND In March 2006, YTMND switched to a Flash preloader[6] for user-submitted pages in order to fix a bug requiring a page refresh to match background sound with animations. YouTube Tutorials Many YouTubers have created video tutorials on creating games and animations using Adobe Flash. As of July 2015, there are over 293,000 search results for the query \"adobe flash tutorial.\"[7]                        Reception Flash has been criticized for its poor performance in resource management, frequent requirement of software updates and a variety of security vulnerabilities. Update Requirements Adobe Flash has gained much notoriety for its frequent release of software updates, which may cause inexplicable crashes or malfunctions for the users if neglected.      Browser Incompatibilities As major web browsers and video-hosting platforms began to phase out their support of  Adobe Flash for HTML5, many users have complained about experiencing sudden  crashes during the playback of a media file.      Security Vulnerabilities In 2011, the Mac Security company Intego[5] released a \"Year in Mac Security\" report, which noted that a trojan virus masquerading as a Flash Player installer had infected Mac OS X users. In early July 2015, several new security vulnerabilities were discovered in Flash, including a hack that allowed cyber criminals to attack a remote target's machine with malicious code.[2] On July 12th, Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos[3][4] posted tweets calling for Adobe to announce an \"end-of-life date for Flash,\" following the security complaints about the software platform (shown below). On the following day, the software company Mozilla disabled Flash by default in their Firefox web browsers.    License Revoking On May 10th, 2019, Twitter user @KupoGames[8] tweeted that he had received an email from Adobe alerting him that they had discontinued certain older versions of their Creative Cloud applications and that as a result, he was no longer licensed to use them.    Others reported that they received emails alerting them which specific applications they were no longer licensed to use Photoshop, Premiere, Lightroom Classic, Animate and Media Director.[9] In response to a customer complaint, @AdobeCare tweeted, \"Customers who continue to use or deploy, unauthorized versions of Creative Cloud may face potential claims of infringement by third parties. We can not comment on claims of third party infringement, as it concerns ongoing litigation. ^CS.\"[10] Legal expert Dylan Gilbert told Vice[11] \"(Adobe) has the power to force its customers to upgrade to newer more expensive versions at its whim, which illustrates the undue power and influence of EULAs over the lives of consumers. We should be able to own the things we buy.\u201d User @Biggaybutchbabe tweeted a Who Killed Hannibal? meme about pirating Adobe, gaining over 600 retweets and 2,000 likes (shown below, left).

The player can choose up to three mercenaries, or 'mercs', to play as during the round, and can switch between them freely between lives. Teamwork and communication are strongly encouraged during the game, hinted at by the ability to revive 'downed' players, as well as the fact that being the 'lone wolf' often leads to a short life. The gameplay is clearly inspired by the style of games like Team Fortress 2, with certain mercenaries having access to abilities like placing ammunition packs, healing stations, or sentry guns. The main goal of the attacking team either begins by repairing and escorting an Extraction Vehicle, abbreviated to 'EV' in-game, to a predetermined location, or to plant C-4 on a certain target. The objectives after that point are more varied from map to map; for example, on the maps Trainyard and Bridge, the attackers' goal is now to steal data cores/drug samples from the defending team and deliver them to a helicopter, while on the rest of the maps, the objectives are only to destroy various targets. Also available on each map are 'side objectives'; objectives that aren't mandatory to complete, but assist the attacking team in completing their ultimate goal. Attackers are encouraged to take advantage of these side objectives before the defending team is able to seize them. There are currently two playable game modes: Objective and Stopwatch.

It was operated off of the XBox Kinect user interface, and while it couldn't walk, it could drive on three wheels at about ten kilometers per hour. It could be armed with a series of cannons made for shooting fireworks or water bottles, and retailed for US $1,353,500.[1][5]  Kickstarter Campaign In 2014, the company Megabots, Inc, created a Kickstarter campaign to raise $1.8 million dollars to fund them to create their own mecha design. While they had only a prototype turret developed, they claimed that their goal was to create two robots that would then battle in an arena they were designing, and that their overall intent was to someday form a sporting league for mecha battle.[2]  They did not reach their funding goal via Kickstarter, eventually only earning $65,000 of the $1.8 million needed. In an update for their backers, the Megabots staff wrote that they believed their failure was due to trying to fund too early, before they had a fully completed working prototype of the first walking robot. However, they did show a prototype, which used caterpillar track-type tread to move around, during the campaign.[3]                    Notable Developments Megabots' Challenge On June 30th, 2015, Megabots USA released a video challenge to Suidobashi, saying that \"we have a giant robot, and you have a giant robot,\" and that it was time for them to fight.[4]  Kuratas' Response Kuratas released a video in response on July 5th, 2015, accepting the challenge, but saying that the guns were \"so American.\" They challenged Megabots to come with something a little \"cooler\" for their final competing robot.  Online Reaction Between June and July, both Kuratas Suidobashi and Megabots garnered substantial followings on social media sites, while demonstration videos of the robots from both companies drew hundreds of thousands of views. Within two weeks of Megabots' challenge video release, it accrued more than 4.7 million views, while Kuratas response video racked up over 3.5 million views in the same time period. Official Announcement On April 5th, 2017, Megabots released a video confirming that the giant robot battle would take place in August of that year in an undisclosed location. The video also contained footage of their nearly-completed robot crushing cars and washing machines. The video has gained over 72,000 views in a day.  Monkey King Battle Announcement On April 29th, 2017, Chinese firm GREATMETAL revealed that they had challenged Megabots to a duel with their new robot 'Monkey King'. That same day, Megabots posted a video on their YouTube channel showcasing the Monkey King(shown below). The Duel has been set to take place after the fight with Kuratas.[11]  Eagle Prime Unveiled On August 2nd, 2017, the MegaBots Inc. channel uploaded footage of their Eagle Prime MK3-class MegaBot, set to battle against a Suidobashi Heavy Industry robot later in September (shown below).  That day, the video was submitted to /r/robotics,[12] where the top comment submitted by Redditor En-tro-py criticized the robot's design, referring to it as a \"junker mech\" with \"high school level design\" and \"too much PR money.\" Meanwhile, several news sites published articles about the recently unveiled robot, including Engadget,[13] Quartz[14] and The Daily Mail.[15] October 2017 Giant Robot Duel On October 17th, 2017, the MegaBots Inc YouTube channel uploaded a 26-minute special featuring a duel between the robots Iron Glory (MK2) and Kuratas, followed by a duel between the Eagle Prime and Kuratus (shown below). In the first duel, Kuratus quickly downed the Iron Glory (MK2) by ramming it with its giant fist. In the second battle, the Kuratus launched a drone at the Eagle Prime, which was immediately hit out of the air. After engaging in close combat, the Eagle Prime was able to defeat the Kuratus with its chainsaw arm. That day the video reached the #3 spot on YouTube trending.  That day, the video was submitted to /r/CringeAnarchy,[16] where it was referred to as a \"cringe fest.\" Meanwhile, The Verge published an article about the fight, which described it as \"less Pacific Rim, and more Rock \u2018em Sock \u2018em robots.\" Meanwhile, posts about the MegaBots victory reached the frontpage of the /r/technology[18] and /r/murica[17] subreddits.

Many of the images bear similarities to the \u201cHow People View Me\u201d two-pane cartoons.    Pretty Princess Points Pretty Princess Points is a series of Wojak images likely stemming from 4chan's /r9k/ board and depicting attractive but mentally unstable and NEET-ish gender-flipped versions of Wojak.    Smug Wojak Smug Wojak refers to a drawing of a bald man with a smug expression on his face that resembles Wojak, inspired by the Smug Frog images. Appearing on /r9k/ and [s4s] in early August 2014, Smug Wojak is normally used to express positive feelings. It also spawned some derivatives, listed on the [s4s] wiki.[4]     Relation with Pepe the frog Wojak has been often related with the character Pepe the Frog, mainly with the Sad Frog variant due their expression of sad emotions. In middle November 2014, Wojak started being paired with Smug Frog on a series of comics named Poo Poo Pee Pee, in which Pepe commits various unethical acts towards Wojak, typically involving urine or feces, and created as a reaction towards the usage of Pepe\u2019s likeness in various mainstream social media sites.

Here in my garage, just bought this new Lamborghini here. It\u2019s fun to drive up here in the Hollywood hills. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Knowledge. In fact, I\u2019m a lot more proud of these seven new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold two thousand new books that I bought. It\u2019s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, \u201cthe more you learn, the more you earn.\u201d Now maybe you\u2019ve seen my TEDx talk where I talk about how I read a book a day. You know, I read a book a day not to show off it\u2019s again about the knowledge. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it\u2019s a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn\u2019t that long ago that I was in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven dollars in my bank account. I didn\u2019t have a college degree, I had no opportunities. But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a mentor. And another mentor. And a few more mentors. I found five mentors. And they showed me what they did to become multimillionaires. Again, it\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s about the good life; health, wealth, love and happiness. And so I record a little video, it\u2019s actually on my website, you can click here on this video and it\u2019ll take you to my website where I share three things that they taught me. Three things that you can implement today no matter where you are. Now, this isn\u2019t a \u201cget rich quick\u201d scheme. You know, like they say if things sound too good to be true they are too good to be true. I\u2019m not promising you that tomorrow you\u2019re gonna be able to go out and buy a Lamborghini. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven steps. So, I record a little two minute video on my website. Like I said, now it\u2019s not the most professional I just shot it here with my iPhone, but it\u2019s real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And I\u2019m going to give you the three most important things you can do today. So click the link, go there it\u2019s completely free to watch it it\u2019s just a couple minutes. Invest in yourself. Always be curious. Don\u2019t be a cynic. Okay, people see videos like this and they say \u201cAh that\u2019s not real that\u2019s for somebody else.\u201d Don\u2019t listen, don\u2019t listen. Be an optimist. Like, Conrad Hilton, the man who started Hilton Hotel, he said that he was only fifteen years old when he read a book by Helen Keller, and that book changed his life. Books can change your life. And in that book, Helen Keller said \u201coptimism\u201d so if you\u2019re a cynic, if you\u2019re a pessimist you don\u2019t need to click here. Don\u2019t worry about it, I don\u2019t need to talk to everybody. But if you\u2019re somebody who knows that there\u2019s something better, cause the dream is possible, you know, for some of you watching it\u2019s not necessarily a Lamborghini, maybe it\u2019s a new job, a new opportunity, starting your own company. Maybe it\u2019s a new lifestyle without so much stress, traveling the world, doing those things you know you\u2019re destined to do. You can do those unless you understand finances. Money, I don\u2019t call it money anymore, I call it fuel units. You must have enough fuel units to live out your dream and to live out your destiny. So, I\u2019ll see you on my website, it\u2019s a quick video and you\u2019ll see there absolutely free. So just click this video and you\u2019ll be taken there in a second, and uh, I\u2019m excited to share this amazing stuff. You\u2019ll see, not because of anything of me but because I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to learn from mentors many years ahead of me. Not just in books like these, although I love books but also real in-person mentors. So let me share with you these three tips that have made all the difference in my life. They\u2019re practical, you can do them today, you can start on them today. All right? See you there on my site.

To appease fans who felt unsatisfied with the ending, Gainax created two movies: Death and Rebirth, a recap that contained the first third of the new ending, and The End of Evangelion, the fully finished ending.[1] Plot The End of Evangelion takes place after the 24th episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion. The film itself is divided into two episodes, labelled 25' and 26' to differentiate them from the TV counterparts. 25' mainly details the attack on NERV headquarters by the Japanese Strategic Self-Defense Force and the deaths that ensue from it, while 26' focuses primarily on the Third Impact, the name given to the show's apocalyptic situation, and Shinji Ikari's internal retrospection on what it means to live.                    Reception Although the film received incredibly polarizing reviews when it was first released, The End of Evangelion has been viewed positively in later years. The film currently has a score of 8.2 on IMDb, an audience score of 81% on Rotten Tomatoes, and a rating of 8.41 on MyAnimeList.[2][3][4] Online Presence Gendowned Gendowned is a series of edits involving the Evangelion character Gendo Ikari shooting a gun at various subjects. The footage of Gendo is taken from an The End of Evangelion scene in which he murders Ritsuko Akagi for attempting to stop the Third Impact.  Komm, s\u00fcsser Tod \"Komm, s\u00fcsser Tod\" (\"Come, sweet death\") is a song performed by Arianne Cleopatra Schreiber and played during the climax of the film in which the Third Impact takes place. The song is especially popular among fans of the series, especially on the imageboard 4chan, where it has been embedded onto various boards of the website in response to \"tragic\" events such as the purchase of the Oculas Rift by Facebook and the retirement of moot as the head of 4chan.[5] The song was uploaded to YouTube on August 16th, 2012, where it received over 14.4 million views in under eight years (shown below).  Tang Tang is a fan name given to LCL, a fictional liquid in the Evangelion series said to be the blood of the angel Lilith. Though LCL does show up in the television series' proper, its most infamous use comes from the Third Impact scene of End of Evangelion in which the remaining living characters are reverted into the substance. Because of its bright orange appearance in the movie, it is commonly joked among fans to resemble the powdered drink Tang, and those who revert into LCL are referred to as \"being tanged\".[6]  Movie Poster The poster for End of Evangelion, which features Shinji Ikari and Asuka Langley Soryu facing the giant head of Rei Ayanami following the failure of the Third Impact, has become an iconic image among anime fans and is occasionally parodied.

While this is the official origin of Tim, Mark and fans have forged their own story for him. In the indie horror game The Plague, Mark claims that the Timothy in that game is who Tim was before his death. After his murder, Timothy possessed the box.

Spread Tiny Box Tim was originally a one-off joke character in A Late Night Drink. However, due to fan reception of the character he has been an integral part of Markiplier's life since. From LixianTV's animation, Tim's popularity soared. Since then, Tim has appeared in other Amnesia custom stories as an actual character, as well as appearances in various fan games like My Name is Mark, Dream.EXE, and With The Addition of Markiplier series. Tim has taken on various roles whether it be antagonist or more commonly support. Tim is also included in the Don't Starve Markiplier mod as a companion and starting chest. During the ALS Charity Livestream back in August 2014, Tiny Box Tim plushies were sold and all the proceeds went to the charity. Mark has also stated that there is not a single Tiny Box Tim, but rather that he is multiple entities.

In an interview with The New York Times,[2] Henderson revealed that he had no personal interest in skateboarding and that the hoverboard Kickstarter was more of a publicity stunt to spark interest in magnetic levitation technology.

After over two decades of public service as an independent legislator for the state of Vermont, Sanders rose to national prominence with the launch of his campaign for the Democratic Party's nomination in the 2016 presidential election on May 26th, 2015.[1] During his campaign, Sanders firmly established himself as a dark horse for the Democratic Party with primary and caucus victories in 22 states. In July 2016, Sanders officially endorsed his rival Hillary Clinton as the Democratic presidential candidate after she secured the number of delegates required for the party's nomination.", "origin": "Political Career", "other_text": "Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce Vinny Sexual Misconduct Allegations        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       History Political Career Bernie Sanders was motivated to enter politics at an early age because his father's family was killed during the Holocaust.[42] Sanders is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history. A self-described democratic socialist, he caucuses with the Democratic Party. Sanders served as a congressman for 16 years before being elected to succeed the retiring Republican-turned-independent Jim Jeffords in the U.S. Senate in 2006. In 2012, he was reelected by a large margin, capturing almost 71% of the popular vote.[1] 2016 U.S. Presidential Campaign Sanders announced his intentions to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for President on April 30th, 2015. Unlike other presidential candidates, Sanders did not pursue funding through a Super PAC, instead focusing on small individual donations.[1] He would be the first non-millionaire president since Harry Truman from 1945.[39] Notably, much of his support comes from online, where so far he has received $15,000,000 in donations in his first quarter as a candidate as of July 2nd, 2015.[8] On September 30th, 2015, Bernie Sanders stated his goal of 1,000,000 individual online contributions had been met and later that day it was revealed he had raised an additional $24,000,000 in donations in this third quarter as candidate, well surpassing Obama's pace at this time in 2008.[28][29] The individual online contributions have doubled to 2,000,000 with 800,000 of the donors donating a second or third time as of December 17th, 2015.[37] This amount increased to 3,000,000 individual online contributions as of January 30th, 2016.[41] Endorsement of Hillary Clinton On July 11th, 2016, the Sanders and Clinton campaigns announced that the pair would be joining each other at a campaign event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire the following day. On July 12th, Sanders and Clinton appeared together at the Portsmouth High School, where Sanders officially conceded the presidential race to Clinton and endorsed her for the next President of the United States (shown below).  That day, several threads about the event reached the front page of the /r/politics,[74] /r/The_Donald,[75] /r/SandersForPresident[76] and /r/PoliticalDiscussion[77] subreddits. Meanwhile, Donald Trump posted a series of tweets condemning the endorsement and urging Sanders supporters to join his campaign (shown below).[78]    Also on July 12th, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein released a statement about the endorsement, where she condemned Clinton's voting record and urged Sanders supporters to throw their support behind the Green Party.[79]  \"I join millions of Americans who see Hillary Clinton's campaign as the opposite of what they and Bernie Sanders have fought for. Despite her penchant for flip flopping rhetoric, Hillary Clinton has spent decades consistently serving the causes of Wall Street, war and the Walmart economy.\"  On Twitter, critics of the endorsement expressed their disapproval in tweets using the hashtags #SelloutSanders,[80] claiming that Sanders had compromised his integrity by supporting his former rival (shown below).    Bernie Campaign Election Response Following the election of Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders' campaign was asked for comment. A tweet by @freddoso[81] claimed that per a CNN source, the Sanders campaign said \"We have nothing polite to say right now.\" The tweet caused speculation that Bernie may have been referring to the results of the Democratic Primary, during which he consistently polled far better than Hillary Clinton in head-to-head matchups with Trump. The idea was a major topic of conversation on Twitter[83] the next day, and The Independent[82] published an article claiming Bernie would have won the election had he been the nominee. 2020 U.S. Presidential Campaign On February 19th, 2019, Bernie Sanders announced that he would be entering the 2020 Democratic Primary, joining a crowded field of Democratic candidates.[84] He made the announcement via an email to supporters on his mailing list and with a campaign announcement video posted to Twitter (shown below). After the announcement, his campaign raised over $1 million in less than four hours.[87]   I'm running for president. I am asking you to join me today as part of an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign that will begin with at least 1 million people from across the country.

Twitter users were split on the announcement. People were quick to argue against Bernie using similar criticisms as were brought up in the 2016 primary. For example, Twitter user @PhillipReines posited that a celebration of Bernie was hypocritical considering how he perceived people treated the idea of a Hillary Clinton run (shown below, left). User @TheHoarseWhisperer tweeted that they would auto-block anyone who supported Sanders (shown below, right).     Such criticisms drew strong counter-criticism from people who believed the criticisms were unfair, especially compared to other Democrats in the field. For example, user @The_Law_Boy tweeted a parody of people saying Sanders' idealistic ideas were unrealistic (shown below, left). User @AmirArminiMD tweeted his enthusiasm for the campaign as a chance to change the country (shown below, right).

Facebook Groups Removal Controversy On April 25th, 2016, several Bernie Sanders-related Facebook groups were purportedly removed from Facebook after being flooded with sexually explicit content, including Bernie Sanders For President 2016,[65] Bernie Sanders 2016 \u2013 Ideas Welcome,[66] Bernie Sanders Activists,[67] Bernie Believers[68] and Bernie Sanders is my Hero.[69] That day, Redditor jbher315 submitted a post about the removals to the /r/SandersForPresident[70] subreddit, where it received upwards of 9,300 votes (75% upvoted) and 1,900 comments in 48 hours.

Additionally, the article included a statement by Bros4Hillary Political Director Alex Mohajer, who disavowed any connection to the Facebook page raids. Additionally, Mohajer claimed the Facebook user connected to the harassment had been removed from the Bros4Hillary group.  \"Bros4Hillary was created as a way to provide a positive and supportive community for supporters of Hillary Clinton to gather, and as a direct response to the hateful and divisive rhetoric used by other campaigns during this election cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not and do not approve of or condone harmful or offensive rhetoric or harassing behavior targeting supporters of any other candidate in the race\u2026\"  By the end of the day, all the Facebook groups had been reinstated. The following day, the Sanders campaign Social Media Manager Aiden King responded to concerns about the closing, claiming that the pages may have been temporarily shut down due to a Facebook bug. Also on April 26th, Snopes[73] published an article about the Facebook group controversy.                    Support Berniebros \"Berniebro\" is a pejorative term referring to fanatical male supporters of 2016 Democratic Presidential Primary candidate Bernie Sanders who supposedly oppose his rival candidate Hillary Clinton based on sexist cultural biases. Since its coinage in late 2015, many Clinton supporters have asserted that the term accurately underscores the basis of Sanders\u2019 affinity with young male Democrats, while others have dismissed it as a straw man argument or smear tactic aimed at detracting criticisms surrounding Clinton\u2019s campaign platform. Rally Turnouts Numerous news outlets and Reddit have reported Bernie Sanders drawing significantly large crowds for his rallies. \"I am surprised by the size of the crowds. In Keene, New Hampshire, on Saturday, we had close to a thousand people,\" Sanders told reporters on June 11th, 2015, at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast in Washington, D.C.[15] These numbers were however dwarfed by another rally he had on June 21st, 2015, in the University of Denver, which had at least 5,500 Coloradans listening to him speak inside the gymnasium.[16] Another rally Bernie Sanders had on July 19th, 2015, drew another larger amount of supporters, having over 11,000 people listening to him speak in downtown Pheonix, Arizona.[17] On August 8th, 2015, Bernie Sanders hosted a rally which gained over 15,000 people, after having been blocked from speaking at Westlake Center due to #BlackLivesMatter protestors disrupting him.[18] A day later on August 9th, 2015, nearly double this number appeared at a Portland rally, with over 19,000 people inside the Moda Center and over 9,000 people outside it. On September 3rd, 2015, people filled the 26,000 person capacity inside the Boston Convention Center for a Bernie Sanders Boston rally, with a large quantity of people also outside the center.[30] On March 21st, 2016, Bernie Sanders hosted 3 rallies across Washington which attracted a combined total of over 30,000 people.[63]  Deez Nuts' Endorsement On August 23rd, 2015, the presidential candidate Deez Nuts (aka Brady Olson) endorsed Bernie Sanders. Brady Olson posted on Facebook \u201cjust gonna throw this out there now. This is not for the general election. My endorsement for the Democratic nomination goes to Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.\u201d In an interview with the Rolling Stone, Deez Nuts wrote that he didn\u2019t want to \u201csee Clinton, Bush, or Trump in the White House, so I guess I\u2019m just trying to put up a fight.\u201d[23]                    Reputation Bernie Sanders has established a reputation for having highly progressive views and being consistent with his voting and political views throughout his lifetime. He is notably far left and has gained a reputation for garnering large crowds at his rallies. Progressivism Since his election to the Senate, Sanders has emerged as a leading progressive voice on issues like income inequality, climate change, and campaign finance reform. He rose to national prominence on the heels of his 2010 filibuster of the proposed extension of the Bush-era tax rates for the wealthy. Sanders is also outspoken on civil liberties issues, and has been particularly critical of mass surveillance policies such as the Patriot Act.[1] Criticism Bernie Sanders has faced two primary criticisms: his appeal to African Americans, and for his stance on gun control -the latter criticism often pointed out by Hillary Clinton. Sanders had blamed some of his issues with minority voters on the fact that he represents a state, Vermont, that is 95% white, and had planned to begin campaigning in the American South with an event in Charleston, South Caroline on the day after the 2015 Charleston Church Shootings, which he was forced to cancel due to the violence.[12] He has a D-minus voting rating by the NRA and often points this out when defending from attacks on his moderate gun control stance. [62] Black Lives Matter Protests Activists aligned with the Black Lives Matter movement have disrupted multiple Bernie Sanders rallies. On August 8th, 2015, Bernie Sanders was supposed to give a speech, but was blocked by Black Lives Matter protesters in a fashion similar to the Black Lives Matter disruption he dealt with three weeks prior (shown below). Conspirists on Reddit have claimed Billionaire George Soros is influencing this behavior by giving millions of dollars to the Black Lives Matter movement while simultaneously being a Hillary Clinton supporter. A likely motivation for this would be the fact Bernie Sanders has vocally opposed financial influence in politics for decades.[19]                    Related Memes Barnie Sandlers @BarnieSandlers, a Twitter parody account of Bernie Sanders, posts a series of political advertisement parodies featuring fake quotes attributed to Bernie Sanders. The first example of the modern template used for \"Barnie Sandlers\" Quotes was posted via Bernie Sander's official Twitter account on May 20th, 2015 (shown below).[24]  The image has been frequently exploited for parodies online, especially on the @BarnieSandlers[25] account on Twitter which has about 150 followers as of July 29th, 2015, and on the Barnie Sandlers profile on Facebook[26] which has over 9,000 likes as of July 29th, 2015. The \"Barnie Sandlers\" quotes typically contain the words \"dank\" or \"meme\" or have a reference to weed. Oftentimes, the image used in the background is replaced with an image of Bernie Sanders having obnoxious hair or have memetic items photoshopped onto him. The name \"Barnie Sandlers\" is likely a pun made from combining the name Bernie Sanders with the names Barney (the Purple dinosaur) and Adam Sandler.      Feel The Bern Feel The Bern is a heavily spread phrase and chant of Bernie Sanders supporters. The phrase's origin is presently unknown but has strong roots in Reddit.[43] This phrase has been heavily applied by the Bernie Sanders campaign for marketing purposes.[44] The twitter hashtag #feelthebern[45] has received a massive amount of retweets. An alternate hashtag, #feelthebarn, was inspired by the Barnie Sandlers meme. Numerous news outlets have been reporting on various important people and states feeling the bern.[46][47][48][49][50][51][52] A notorious example of the phrase was displayed by Bernie Sanders himself on Stephen Colbert's The Late Show, where Bernie Sanders briefly spoke about a 'Feel the Bern' mug.[53] Another reference was made to the phrase when Bernie Sanders was shown dancing onto the stage of The Ellen DeGeneres Show to the song 'Disco Inferno' to the lyrics 'burn baby burn'. His dancing from that appearance has since spread on the internet for being funny and cringe-worthy.[54]  Bernie Sanders' Hair While discussion of his policy stances in the mainstream media has been comparably sparse, there have been several news media mentions of Senator Sanders' hair, which often becomes unkempt during campaign events. On April 29th, 2015, the day before Sanders' official campaign announcement, the Washington Post published an article titled \"Great Moments in Bernie Sanders' hair\", featuring photographs of his hair waving about accompanied by humorous captions.[9] On May 15th, 2015, New York Magazine collected media quotes about the Senator's hair, saying that the press had been obsessed with his physical appearance in a way that wasn't present for any other candidate.[10] On August 17th, 2015, Bernie Sanders berated a reporter for asking about his hair, stating \"O.K., Ana, I don't mean to be rude here. I am running for president of the United States on serious issues, okay? Do you have serious questions?\"[22]     #BernieSoBlack #BernieSoBlack is a satirical hashtag created by social progressives in response to Bernie Sanders' perceived excessive focus on economic issues to the detriment of social issues. It was created by Roderick Morrow, a podcaster and comedian, after an altercation between Sanders and #BlackLivesMatter protesters at a Netroots Nation conference (a convention for left-leaning political activists). Sanders's supporters promptly defended his record on social issues online, pointing out in particular that he participated in the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. In an interview with Vox,[14] Morrow explained the reasoning behind his creation of the hashtag.  Whenever he's asked a question, he goes into a spiel on economics -- which is fine, obviously, people do want wage and class equality. But certain issues are race issues, and they do need to be talked about, at least from a candidate that I would like to vote for. [\u2026] And it seems like any time black people bring this up on Twitter, there's all these people who, I don't know, they're just sitting around searching his name on Twitter or something, they just come and get in your mentions and start harassing you, they start saying the same things over and over to you, like, \"He marched with Dr. Martin Luther King\" [\u2026]  I'm not denigrating that work, but it's almost as if they're trying to say, \"You shouldn't expect him to continue this\" or, \"Because he's done stuff in the past, you shouldn't question him now.\"  The hashtag quickly began trending, spawning several notable examples.   #BernieSoBlack HE teaches you how to Cha Cha Slide! https://t.co/3CJorwWn9b \u2014 Rod TBGWT (@rodimusprime) July 19th, 2015       #BernieSoBlack he dies first in every horror movie \u2014 Tim Black (@TimBartender) July 19th, 2015       #berniesoblack he's only running for president to distribute his mixtape. \u2014 T-Spang (@B_Spangdang) July 19th, 2015      #DamnEmails During the first debate for the 2016 Democratic Presidential Primary held on October 13th, 2015, Sanders addressed Hillary Clinton to comment on a political scandal regarding sensitive government emails sent via her personal email account, saying \"the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails\" (shown below).  Immediately after, Twitter users began tweeting about the statement along with the hashtag \"#DamnEmails,\"[32] gathering upwards of 1,800 mentions in the first 24 hours according to Topsy.[31] Additionally, the @damnemails[33] Twitter feed was launched, featuring tweets about the debate exchange. In the coming days, several news sites published articles about the online reaction to Sanders comment, including Wired,[34] Yahoo[35] and NY Daily News.[36]       Bernie or Hillary? Bernie or Hillary? refers to a series of fake campaign posters supporting Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Presidential Primary against Hillary Clinton in which Sanders is depicted as being more knowledgable than Clinton on a series of popular but apolitical topics.    \"Bernie Sandwiches\" and \"Bernie Sandals\" Following Sanders' victory in the New Hampshire Democratic primary on February 9th, 2016, he was mistakenly referred to as \"Bernie Sandwiches\" by MSNBC news anchor Chris Hayes and \"Bernie Sandals\" by Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly. Immediately after, the Mashable News Vine feed posted clips of the gaffes (shown below).     That evening, Twitter user @jennychawla_[55] posted a photoshopped picture of a pair of sandals with a Sanders campaign promotional image printed on the top (shown below, left). Meanwhile, other Twitter users posted photoshops and jokes about Bernie Sanders sandwhiches (shown below, right).[56][60][61] In the coming days, several news sites reported on the online reactions to the gaffes, including The Daily Dot,[57] UpRoxx[58] and NPR.[59]     Birdie Sanders Birdie Sanders is the nickname given to a bird that flew onto the podium in front of the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during his speech at a campaign rally in Portland, Oregon in late March 2016.    #BernieMadeMeWhite #BernieMadeMeWhite is a hashtag used to joke about the media\u2019s representation of Bernie Sanders supporters as Caucasian during the 2016 Democratic Presidential Primary. The hashtag became popular after media reports of Sanders victories depicted diverse states, including Hawaii, as being \u201cwhite and rural.\u201d Bernie Sanders Glowsticks Hoax Bernie Sanders Glowsticks is a viral hoax image aimed at tricking supporters of the 2016 Democratic presidential primary candidate Bernie Sanders into making chlorine bombs by providing false instructions for making homemade luminescent light sticks.    #BernieLostMe #BernieLostMe is a hashtag used by supporters of the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to share their reasons as to why the rival candidate Bernie Sanders is the less suitable nominee for the Democratic National Convention, which began trending after Sanders refused to denounce some of his supporters who behaved violently at the Nevada Democratic Convention in May 2016.

Background In the aftermath of the mass shooting of nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina on June 17th, 2015, a national debate ensued over whether the display of the Confederate flag should be banned from official government buildings, such as the one flying over South Carolina\u2019s state capitol. That weekend, President Barack Obama appeared on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast for an interview, where the president used the word \"nigger\" during a discussion about the state of racial relations in America, which prompted a concurrent public discussion on whether it is appropriate to use the slur regardless of context.

From there, a journalist named Thomas Gounley picked up the search for a newspaper called the Springfield News-Leader, in Springfield Missouri, the region in which the cups were manufactured. He was able to track Gina down to Aurora, Illinois, and interview her for his story. He began with the five questions asked by mcglaven on Reddit.

Since its formation in 1985, the band has released a number of critically acclaimed alternative rock and electronic songs in their career spanning over three decades.", "origin": "", "other_text": "Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce Vinny Sexual Misconduct Allegations        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       Online History Pablo Honey The members of Radiohead met in 1985 while attending Abingdon School at Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. In 1992, the band recorded and released their first and most popular single to-date \"Creep,\" though it didn't become a hit until it was re-released as the lead single for their debut album Pablo Honey in 1993. Upon its mainstream debut, the song climbed to the 7th place on UK Billboards[2] and made them an internationally famous band, though some members, including the frontman Thom Yorke, later remarked that the overwhelming success of \"Creep\" had cast a shadow on other tracks on their first album. The Bends In 1995, Radiohead released their sophomore album The Bends, produced by John Leckie and engineered by Nigel Godrich, who would go on to produce all future albums by the band. The album was seen by some as the beginning of a shift in aesthetics and style of music for the band, marked by increased presence of keyboards and juxtaposition of abrasive guitar tracks with subtler ones. OK Computer In June 1997, Radiohead released their third studio and first self-produced album OK Computer, which reached number one on the UK Albums chart upon its debut and also became the band's highest album entry at number 21 on U.S. Billboard 200 at the time. In a bold, deliberate departure from the guitar-centric sounds and introspective lyrics of their previous Britpop works, OK Computer set itself as a major turning point for the band's shift in artistic direction towards more melancholic and atmospheric sounds. The album was also met with unanimous critical acclaims from the review circles; it won the Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year at the 1998 Grammy Awards, the first Grammy Awards recognition of the band's career, and it is often cited by many as one of the greatest rock albums of the 1990s. Kid A & Amnesiac In October 2000, Radiohead released their fourth album, Kid A, the first of two albums from these recording sessions. Rather than being a stylistic sequel to OK Computer, Kid A featured a minimalist and textured style with more diverse instrumentation including the ondes Martenot, programmed electronic beats, strings, and jazz horns. It debuted at number one in many countries, including the US, where its debut atop the Billboard chart marked a first for the band, and the first US number one album by any UK musician since the Spice Girls in 1996. This success was attributed variously to marketing, to the album's leak on the file-sharing network Napster a few months before its release. In Rainbows In October 2007, Radiohead unveiled their seventh studio album, which was self-produced and initially self-distributed on a pay-what-you-want model through a website, followed by its retail release across the world during the last week of December that year. As the band's first release after the expiration of their contract with EMI, In Rainbows, along with its heavily grassroots marketing and honor-based distribution models, was met by overwhelmingly positive reaction from the critics and fans alike and garnered heavy attention from the news media, with some hailing the band's decision to release the album online as \"a revolution in the way major bands sell their music\" and \"easily the most important release in the recent history of the music business.\"                    Reputation Radiohead has been a popular band on the 4chan music board /mu/, normally being classified as /mu/core (essential music for beginners of the forum) for their more experimental albums often for their groundbreaking use of electronics.    \"Creep\" Being their most famous song to this day, Creep has reached 92,425,984 views and 403,283 likes (shown below), as well as inspired countless covers, remixes and parodies.  Parodies & Tributes             Thom Yorke Also famous is the reputation of the frontman, Thom Yorke, known for his horrible temperament which one magazine on with \"\u2026acid sarcasm, tense silences, sullen grunts and Kevin The Teenager huff. And, just occasionally, violent outbursts. Later, he will threaten to break the legs of Uncut's music editor. And he will be deadly serious.\"[3]  The Sheer popularity of Creep often angers him, because fans often ignore their other songs making him temperamental \"When fans inevitably request \"Creep,\" Yorke has responded on various occasions by telling them to fuck off, storming offstage, and inexplicably calling everyone in the audience \"anally retarded\u2026[sic]\"[5] this has become a subject of jokes amongst fans, painting Yorke as an easily angered pedantic old man[6] with a terrible disdain for his own song.  OK Computer Recordings Leak On June 5th, the alleged entire recordings from the OK Computer recording sessions leaked online. They were brought to the attention of the internet in a thread posted in /r/Radiohead[7] by user abalechichi. There are eighteen disks of leaked recordings, totaling roughly 18 hours of music. Several internet users compiled a Google Doc with timestamps marking that appeared and when on the discs.[8] On June 11th, 2019, guitarist Jonny Greenwood tweeted about the leak, saying that a hacker had stolen the material and threatened to leak it unless paid a $150,000 ransom.[9] In response, the band had decided to release all the material themselves on Bandcamp[10] for the price of 18 pounds and for a period of 18 days, with proceeds going to Extinction Rebellion, a climate activist group.

The video ignited a feud between Leafy and Klein that was subsequently referred to as #MemeGate.  Bold Guy Copyright Lawsuit On May 24th, 2016, Ethan and Hila Klein of h3h3productions uploaded a video revealing that their channel was being sued by YouTuber Matt Hosseinzadeh (a.k.a. MattHossZone or \"Bold Guy\") for copyright infringement (shown below). In the video, Klein explains the brief history of legal threats they had received from Hosseinzadeh over the course of several months and accuses Hosseinzadeh of filing a frivolous lawsuit based on a reaction video commentary that they had published about Hosseinzadeh's video \"Bold Guy Picks Up Girl During Parkour.\"[12] Additionally, Klein claims that the lawsuit will cost $100,000 in legal defense costs. That day, the video reached the front page of the /r/videos[10] and /r/h3h3productions[11] subreddits.  The following day, YouTuber Philip DeFranco posted a video about the lawsuit (shown below) and launched a GoFundMe[13] page titled \"Help for H3h3,\" asking fans to donate money to help pay for Klein's legal costs. In 24 hours, the campaign raised upwards of $114,000 of its $100,000 goal, with several large contributions from various YouTubers, including DeFranco, Markiplier, Michael Green, Keemstar, PewDiePie and JackSepticEye. Additionally, Minecraft creator Markus Persson provided the largest donation of $8,179.  On August 23, 2017 Ethan tweeted out \"We won the lawsuit. Video coming soon. Huge victory for fair use on YouTube.\"(shown below)[14]    Hila Klein that same day tweeted \"No better way to wake up than to a text from your lawyer saying WE WON!!!\"(shown below)[15]    Later that day, H3H3Productions released a video thanking those that supported them and celebrating their victory(shown below).

Among those dead at the scene was Reverend Clementa C. Pinckney, the church's senior pastor and Democratic state senator.                         Notable Developments Official Responses In the immediate aftermath, the Charleston Police Department responded by declaring the assault as an act of hate crime and launching a manhunt of a suspect described by witnesses as a young white man wearing a gray sweatshirt and jeans. The police also released photographs of the suspect from surveillance footage, a youthful looking white man with bowl-shape cut blonde hair, and other details surrounding the shooter at large. In addition to the local authorities' operation, the F.B.I., the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for South Carolina also launched a joint investigation into the shooting.     In the following hours of the tragedy, President Barack Obama (shown below) and many other public figures, including more than a dozen of prospective candidates for the upcoming 2016 U.S. presidential election, condemned the attack as a despicable act of hate crime. By early morning on June 19th, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley had issued a statement affirming the state's intention to seek the death penalty against Roof.  Online Reaction Meanwhile on Twitter and elsewhere online, many pointed out what they perceived as a racial bias in the official and news media description of mass murder suspects, as well as inappropriateness of the Confederate flag flying at the South Carolina State House in Columbia.       Suspect's Arrest On the morning of June 18th, after about 14 hours of an intensive manhunt for the suspect, a 21-year-old man named Dylann Storm Roof was arrested and taken into police custody during a traffic stop on U.S. Route 74 in Shelby, North Carolina. Following his capture, Roof was transferred to Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston that same evening, where he was assigned the cell-block next to Michael Slager, the former North Charleston Police Department officer charged with first-degree murder in the case of Walter Scott's death in early April.  On June 19th, Roof made his first public appearance at a bond hearing in Charleston County courthouse, where he was  formally charged with nine counts of murder and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime (shown below). Roof is scheduled to reappear before court on October 23rd, 2015.  Dylann Roof's Brony Hoax Following Dylann Roof's capture, Twitter user @RaspberryPirate tweeted a photograph of the suspect in police custody that has been partially photoshopped to make it seem as if he were a Brony dressed in a My Little Pony-themed t-shirt featuring an image of Rainbow Dash at the time of his arrest (shown below).  On June 20th, the New York Times[12] published an article on the emerging details of Roof's online activities and digital footprint in the social media, which reported that prior to the late discovery of the website, Roof had allegedly posted a similarly worded tirade on a separate Tumblr blog, where he also shared images of 9/11-related memes and My Little Pony fan art, citing an anecdotal account of a 16-year-old British blogger named Benjamin Wareing who claims to have taken notes on the blog post as part of his essay on the impact of Tumblr on youth psyschology. In the following hour, the circumstantial details about Roof's mysterious Tumblr presence were picked up by the Boston Globe[16] and New York Magazine[17] (shown below), shortly before they were redacted from the original articles later that same day.      \u201cHe just made really stupid but obvious statements about people from other races,\u201d Mr. Wareing said in an email. \u201cHe would call black citizens \u2018nuggets\u2019 and such. He never made direct threats at all on Tumblr, at least it didn\u2019t seem like that, just weird ramblings about how he felt he \u2018didn\u2019t fit in.\u2019\u201d  Also on June 20th, Benjamin Wareing ran a post titled \"Why I Messed With The Biggest News Outlet in The World \u2013 A Report\" on his website Next Generation Blogs[15], in which the blogger confirmed that the statements he provided to the New York Times reporter were fabricated in its entirety.  We chose to focus on the \u201cBrony\u201d scene of \u201cMy Little Pony\u201d, emphasizing the fact that Roof was a major Brony. We also wanted a bit of best modern-day internet can give; memes. We told this idiot of a reporter that Dylann was obsessed with 911 \u2018memes\u2019. Of course, we have no way of knowing if this is true. As we expected, the New York Times reporter took to this like a fat kid in a candy store. No questions asked.  Discovery of Manifesto On June 20th, Twitter user @HenryKrinkle[9] used a reverse domain search service to track down a website believed to have been registered by the 21-year-old suspect and tweeted a link[14] to the page with an open call for someone to unmask its web address for a one-time fee of $49 USD. In less than three hours, the domain of the website in question was identified as LastRhodesian.com by @EMQuangel[10], a blogger who goes by the pen name Emma Quangel.  First registered on February 9th by an individual whose name matches that of the suspect, Dylann Storm Roof, the website[11] features a 2,500-word statement in which the author boasts his allegiance to White supremacist agendas and spews his opinions on several different minority groups, along with a collection of over 60 photographs in which Roof is seen posing at various heritage sites and museums associated with the U.S. Confederacy and slavery of African Americans. In the alleged manifesto, the author also cites the case of Trayvon Martin's death and the subsequent trial of George Zimmerman as his apparent motive behind his attack.   \"I have no choice, I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.\"  Dylann Roof Fan Arrested On December 10th, 2018, police arrested 23-year-old Elizabeth Lecron, the founder of a Tumblr page dedicated to Dylann Roof, in Northern Ohio for plotting an act of domestic terrorism (Lecron shown below). Lecron, who had previously visited the Columbine High School, the site of the infamous 1999 school shooting, ran the Tumblr page \"CharlestonMiracleMile,\"[19] a site named after Roof's attack and dedicated to mass shooters, amongst other things. Additionally, Lecron corresponded with Roof in prison, attempting to send him \"Nazi literature.\"    Authorities say she planned to commit \"upscale mass murder\" outside of a bar in Toledo, telling her associate that she knew the bar inside and out. Vice[20] reported, \"She discussed buying bomb-making materials with an undercover agent, and on Saturday, she purchased two pounds of black powder from a retail sporting good stores, and 665 screws of various sizes from another retailer.\" According to  U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio Justin E. Herdman, \"[Lecron]  bought black powder and hundreds of screws that she expected would be used to make a bomb. Through her words and actions, she demonstrated that she was committed to seeing death and destruction in order to advance hate.\"                    Search Interest                         External References  [1] Wikipedia \u2013 Charleston Church Shooting [2] Washington Post \u2013 Dylann Roof, suspect in Charleston church shooting, has been captured [3] CNN \u2013 Charleston church shooting: Multiple fatalities in South Carolina, source says [4] NBC News \u2013  Nine Killed at Historic Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina [5] New York Times \u2013 Charleston Church Shooting Suspect, Dylann Storm Roof, Captured [6] TIME \u2013 Everything We Know About the Charleston Shooting [7] Independent \u2013 Charleston shooting: Five-year-old child who 'played dead' among survivors in South Carolina [8] Twitter \u2013 #CharlestonShooting [9] Twitter \u2013 @HenryKrinkle's Tweet [10] Twitter \u2013 @EMQuangel's Tweet [11] LastRhodesian.com \u2013 Original Text (warning: contains disturbing content) [12] New York Times \u2013 Dylann Roof Photos and a Manifesto Are Posted on Website [13] Gawker \u2013 Here Is What Appears to Be Dylann Roof\u2019s Racist Manifesto [14] DomainTools \u2013 Reverse Whois for 'Dylann Storm Roof' [15] Next Generation Blogs \u2013 Why I Messed With The Biggest News Outlet in The World \u2013 A Report [16] New York Magazine \u2013 Dylann Roof Made a Website to Explain His Attack [17] Boston Globe \u2013 Dylann Roof photos and a manifesto found on website [18] Fusion \u2013 How a 16-year-old tricked the New York Times into reporting that Dylann Roof blogged about \u201cMy Little Pony\u201d [19] NSFW Tumblr \u2013 CharlestonMiracleMile [20] VICE \u2013 Ohio woman arrested for domestic terror plot had been corresponding with Dylann Roof                    Latest Editorial And News       How Standing On The Gravitron Became The Ultimate Meme Of Rebellion        TikToker Justine Paradise Accuses Jake Paul Of Sexual Assault        Legendary Rapper DMX Dies At 50        Maggie Goldenberger Auctioning Off Original \u2018Ermahgerd\u2019 Photo As Meme NFTs Continue Trending Online"}, "Metroid Prime: Federation Force": {"image": "https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/018/281/KYM_MPFF.jpg", "type": [], "origin_year": "2015", "date_added": "2015-06-18T13:07:28-04:00", "views": 12175, "videos": 8, "photos": 24, "comments": 182, "about": "Metroid Prime: Federation Force is a first-person co-op shooting game.

For instance, during the protests of SOPA/PIPA in 2012, many advocates claimed that the legislation would \"break the Internet\", meaning that it would fundamentally change how the Internet operated by creating an access hierarchy.[3]    In addition, during the 2012 Davos convention, Google CEO Erik Schmidt was quoted saying that the EU's proposed \"Right to be forgotten\" legislation would \"Break the Internet.\"[4] Using the term as a reference to viral content began in early 2014.

In less than 24 hours, the tweet racked up more than 3,200 retweets and 2,500 favorites.[6]  Since the cover, the term has gone into wide use as other narratives or stories have been perceived as breaking the internet or as trying to break the Internet. The term was used extensively in media descriptions of the reactions to Caitlyn Jenner's Vanity Fair Cover, most likely due to her familial relationship to Kim Kardashian. The Washington Post claimed in a headline \"Actually, Caitlyn Jenner just broke the Internet,\" and the term was used in relationship to the story on Twitter about 10,000 times. However, as of June 2015, the term maintains a high rate of use.

It takes a certain type of talent, with an awesome fan base and the ability to put trust in PAPER to work our magic. I have always loved all of the looks that Nicki has done (and she has done them all). Her style (typically anchored by her off-the-charts hair choices) matches her musical talent perfectly. Break the Internet is all about the big idea, the word, the image. It came to me one day that 'Minaj \u00e0 trois' had never been done. HOW? We have seen different versions of Nicki, from high fashion to seductive to in-your-face and eye-catching all at the same time.

Buster Sword The Buster Sword is an iconic weapon from the Final Fantasy video games series, being Cloud\u2019s default weapon in Final Fantasy 7. Its massive size has made it one of the most well-known examples of \u201cunreal sized swords on media[1].\u201d Due to the success of the series, the weapon has since become popular among fans which spawn discussions, fanart and even custom made replicas. Other Final Fantasy characters such as Gilgamesh from Final Fantasy XII and the protagonist Lightning from Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII can also equip the Buster Sword.

Online, the scene has frequently been used as a death spoiler reveal.  The phrase \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they just use a Phoenix Down?\u201d is a joke associated with the character\u2019s death, pointing out that her companions could have revived her using the \u201cPhoenix Down\u201d in-game resurrection item.

Grossing more than $59 million in the domestic box office, the film spurred a sequel shortly thereafter.[24] Predator 2, which starred Danny Glover and changed the jungle setting for a futuristic Los Angeles, California, made decidedly less at the box office, halting future sequels for 15 years.[25]     Following Predator 2, the character would frequently be used in a successful line of action figures, comic books and video games, with one of the most popular adaptation being the Alien vs. Predator franchise. In 2004, a film adaptation of Alien vs. Predator was released in the United States. The film made more than $170 million in worldwide box office, allowing for a sequel, Alien vs. Predator: Requiem, three years later.  On July 7th, 2010, a third Predator film, entitled _Predators, was released in the United States. The Predator In 2014, 20th Century Fox announced that they would be producing a new Predator film directed by Iron Man 3-director and Predator-star Shane Black. The film would aim to reinvigorate the franchise, while connecting the various sequels on a linear timeline, acting as a sequel to the first two films and a prequel to Predators.  Sex Offender Casting Controversy On August 15th, 2018, star Olivia Munn demanded a scene from the film, in which she plays opposite Steven Wilder Striegel, a registered sex offender. Munn told reporters that Black had not informed her of Striegel's hisory, specifically that in 2010 he pleaded guilty of attempting to lure a 14-year-old girl into a sexual relationship via the internet.[26] The studio released a statement on the controversy, stating, \"Our studio was not aware of Mr. Striegel\u2019s background when he was hired. We were not aware of his background during the casting process due to legal limitations that impede studios from running background checks on actors.\" Shane Black said, \"I personally chose to help a friend. I can understand others might disapprove, as his conviction was on a sensitive charge and not to be taken lightly.\" Munn, however, was disappointed for being put in the situation. She said that she found it \"both surprising and unsettling that Shane Black, our director, did not share this information to the cast, crew, or Fox Studios prior to, during, or after production.\u201d \u201cI am relieved that when Fox finally did receive the information, the studio took appropriate action by deleting the scene featuring Wilder prior to release of the film.\u201d The scene was removed, and Munn stated that she would continue to do press for the film because she was contactually obligated to. She tweeted,[27] \"I\u2019m contractually obligated. And from what I\u2019m experiencing, I think they\u2019d prefer I not show up. It would make everyone breathe easier. Also, I worked really hard on this film, as did the rest of the cast and crew. Now that the scene is deleted I think audiences will love it.\"                       Fandom Fan Art Predator has a sizable following online on several sites. On Tumblr there are various posts tagged to the franchise,[8] as well as several blogs dedicated to Predator.[9][10][11][12] On Reddit this is a dedicated subreddit to Predator[13] as well as to Alien vs. Predator[14]. On DeviantArt there are nearly 700,000 pieces of fanart for Predator,[15] as well as several groups and accounts dedicated to the franchise.[16][17][18]       Fan Films For many years there have been fan made films that are centered around the Predator mythos. An early example of this was a fan-made film entitled Batman: Dead End in which The Dark Knight faces off against both an Alien and a Predator. The film was initially shown on July 19, 2003 at the San Diego Comic-Con[19], and was released onto the creator's personal website not long after. However the site has since been apparently abandoned and the film is no longer available there. The film has been uploaded many times to YouTube (for example: the one shown below).  One of the earliest instances of these films on YouTube is called \"PREDATOR 3 fan film Corto gore caspa friki\" uploaded by YouTuber paco culebra on May 6, 2006 (shown below left). On June 1, 2007, YouTuber murphy38 uploaded a video called \"ROBOCOP VS PREDATOR. Work in progress\" (shown below right).     Several of these fan films pit the Predator monster against characters from other well known franchises. On July 14, 2012 YouTuber freakinrad uploaded a video titled \"Halo vs. Predator\" which has over 4 million views as of June 2015 (shown below left). On August 14, 2013 YouTuber batinthesun uploaded a video entitled \"WOLVERINE vs PREDATOR\" as part of their Super Power Beat Down series (shown below right). As of June 2015 the video has nearly 13 million views, making it the most viewed Predator fan film to date.     Om June 29, 2014, a Kickstarter page for a film entitled Predator: Dark Ages was launched.[20] The Kickstarter reached it's goal on August 8, 2014. The film was released on YouTube on May 25, 2015 (shown below). The film was reported upon by sites such as blastr,[21] TheWrap,[22] and ComicBook.com.[23]                     Related Memes Get To The Choppa! \"Get To The Choppa!\" is a memorable quote said by Major Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) in the 1987 sci-fi action film Predator. Due to Schwarzenegger's thick European accent, the line came off as a comical relief rather than exclamation of urgency and it eventually became one of the most celebrated quotes attributed to the actor. On forums and message boards, the quote is used in a playful manner to indicate there is an imminent danger and everyone must evacuate immediately.

In the first 48 hours, the tweet gained over 1,100 favorites and 980 retweets.    That day, other Twitter users began mocking the logo with photoshopped parodies (shown below). On June 15th, The Daily What published a compilation of notable photoshopped examples.      Also on June 15th, Bush officially announced his candidacy for the Republican Party nomination in the 2016 United States Presidential election.  After a lengthy decline from original popular favorite to bottom of the polls, Jeb dropped out of the election February 21st, 2016. Guaca Bowle On August 4th, 2015, Jeb Bush unveiled a new campaign store on his web site, where supporters could purchase merchandise, most of which was branded with the campaign's logo. One item which remained unbranded was a molcajete, or Mexican guacamole bowl, which was labeled \"Guaca Bowle\" and cost $75 from the campaign.[5] Accompanying the molcajete was this promotional text:  Jeb and Columba love whipping up guacamole on Sunday Funday. Now, you can get in on the act with this \u201cGuaca Bowle.\u201d Jeb\u2019s secret guacamole recipe not included\u2026yet.  The molcajete quickly became a source of ridicule for the Bush campaign, especially considering that similar models were available on Amazon for far cheaper. In addition, since the unveiling of the molcajete happened in near proximity to the release of the Pea Guacamole Recipe, many of the satirical tweets combined the two events.[6]       The launching of the campaign store and the unveiling of the Guaca Bowle became the source material for a satirical web store called Jeb!SwagStore and was covered in a variety of political publications, including Talking Points Memo,[7] the Guardian,[8] and the Week,[9] and was featured on an episode of Late Night With Stephen Colbert on September 9th, 2015.  Green Screen Photoshop On October 8th, 2015, Jeb Bush tweeted a photograph[10] of himself posing in front of a green screen while being trained on giving a weather forecast at the local TV station WHO-HD in Des Moines, Iowa.  That same day, Redditor Supreme-Leader-Snoke submitted the photograph to /r/photoshopbattles[11], spawning a series of photoshopped parodies featuring the Republican presidential candidate in various comedic situations.

According to Lieder's original account, the aliens had warned her of an impending global catastrophe that would supposedly take place on May 23rd, 2003, during which the surface of our planet would be devastated by a violent disruption of its magnetic core as a result of its extremely close encounter with another planet four times the size of the Earth.", "other_text": "Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce Vinny Sexual Misconduct Allegations        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       Origin In 1995, Nancy Lieder, a Wisconsin resident who claims that she was contacted by a group of grey aliens known as \"Zetas\" and had her brain implanted with a communications device during her childhood, laid out the foundation of the planetary collision theory on her newly launched website ZetaTalk.com. According to Lieder's original account, the aliens had warned her of an impending global catastrophe that would supposedly take place on May 23rd, 2003, during which the surface of our planet would be devastated by a violent disruption of its magnetic core as a result of its extremely close encounter with another planet four times the size of the Earth.                     Spread In 1996, Lieder made a connection between Planet X and the planet \"Nibiru\" as mentioned in the books by Zecharia Sitchin. Although Sitchin denied connection between him and Lieder, and that his book The End of Days claimed Nibiru would return sometime around 2900, many believers of Lieder and Sitchin's stories associated the two stories with each other. Comet Hale-Bopp's Perihelion In 1997, Lieder's Nibiru Collision theory first came to public attention through various Internet newsgroups devoted to discussions of extraterrestrials, which coincided with the news media's growing interest in Comet Hale\u2013Bopp's perihelion that occurred in April that year. On her website, Lieder stated that the public's heightened interest Comet Hale-Bopp had been  manufactured to distract the masses from the imminent approach of an unknown \"Planet X,\" while arguing that the comet is actually a distant star that poses little threat to the Earth.  On March 28th, 1997, shortly before the observance of the comet's perihelion, the New York Times mentioned Lieder's theory in an article titled \"Comets Breed Fear, Fascination and Web Sites.\"  According to the Zetas, Nancy writes, the comet is part of a conspiracy to deflect the world's attention from the ''true messenger of death,'' the 12th Planet, which is supposedly set to sweep by Earth and knock it for a loop.  After Hale-Bopp's perihelion revealed it as one of the brightest and longest-observed comets of the last century, Lieder redacted the first two sentences of her initial statement from her website. May 23rd, 2003 As Lieder continued to expound her theory through ZetaTalk, Mark Hazlewood, a conspiracy theorist and former member of Leider's online forum community, wrote about the topic in his 2001 book Blindsided: Planet X Passes in 2003. In mid-May 2003, about a week before the Earth's supposed encounter with Planet X, Lieder appeared on the Los Angeles-based radio station KROQ-FM to urge listeners to euthanize their pets in anticipation of the catastrophic event. Meanwhile in Japan, members of the cult group Pana Wave Laboratory also spread similar warnings about an impending doomsday and reportedly \"blocked off roads and rivers with white clothes\" in anticipation of electromagnetic attacks that would result from the approach of a mysterious \"tenth planet\" in May 2003. Following the passing of the date without any incident, Lieder casually dismissed her previous statement as a white lie \"to fool the establishment.\" August 23rd, 2018 On August 13th, 2018, the British tabloid Express[13] reported that conspiracy theorist David Meade believes that Nibiru will appear before the Earth. The planet will then pass the Earth in October 2018, signaling the start of the rapture and the end of the world. He states: During this time frame, on April 23, 2018 the moon appears under the feet of the Constellation Virgo.  \u201cThe Sun appears to precisely clothe Virgo\u2026 Jupiter is birthed on April 08, 2018.  \u201cThe 12 stars at that date include the nine stars of Leo, and the three planetary alignments of Mercury, Venus and Mars \u2013 which combine to make a count of 12 stars on the head of Virgo.  \u201cThus the constellations Virgo, Leo and Serpens-Ophiuchus represent a unique once-in-a-century sign exactly as depicted in the 12th chapter of Revelation. This is our time marker.\" Various media oulets covered the story, debunking the notion that the world will end in 2018, stating that conspiracy theorists frequently change the date when the world does not end when predicted, including The Washington Post,[15] Mashable, [16] Forbes[17] and more. NASA's Debunking of Nibiru Theory NASA's website refutes the believe that Nibiru will crash into the Earth. According to the NASA website,[14] Nibiru has not been discovered in the out solar system. Some conspiracy theorists assert that a small commet called \"Elenin\" is Nibiru. This comet was said to have shifted the Earth's axis, causing earthquakes in Chile and Japan, despite the fact that comets cannot cause earthquakes, plate tectonics do. David Morrison, a planetary astronomer at NASA Ames Research Center and senior scientist at the NASA Astrobiology Institute and NASA Lunar Science Institute, wrote: \"The fact is that these folks are constantly changing their story. For some, Nibiru is no longer the Sumerian god or planet that is supposed to be returning to Earth in late 2012. It has become a catchword for almost any cosmic catastrophe.\"                    Various Examples Many supplementary theories and hoaxes have since surfaced around the topic, including claims of a government conspiracy theory involving NASA's cover-up of Nibiru's existence. One of the more well known claims is that the star V838 Mon and its increasing light echo is actually Nibiru getting closer to the Earth.  While Lieder has repeatedly refused to disclose her predictions regarding the expected date of its occurrence, the online interest in the theory saw a significant resurgence during the latter half of 2012, as the Mayan prediction of the doomsday on December 21st, 2012 heavily circulated in the social media.

After police investigated the incident, they determined the package had not been processed by the local postal service, and could only have been placed in the box by a postal worker or key holder.  Racial Identity On June 11th, 2015, the Coeur d\u2019Alene Press[3] published an interview with Dolezal's biological parents, who claimed that their daughter had been misrepresenting her racial identity for several years. The article also noted that Dolezal indicated she was \"white,\" \"African American\" and \"Native American\" on her police oversight committee application.                    Notable Developments KXLY Interview The same day, the local news station KXLY uploaded an interview Dolezal, in which she discusses the various hate crimes she has reported over the years. After being confronted by the interviewer about whether she identifies as \"African American,\" Dolezal abruptly ends the interview and walks off camera.  Dolezal's Response Also on June 11th,, the Spokesman Review[8] published an interview with Dolezal, in which she avoided directly answering questions about her racial identity, saying \"That question is not as easy as it seems\" and \"We're all from the African continent.\" The article also included a statement by Dolezal's mother Ruthanne, who claimed \"the family's ancestry is Czech, Swedish and German\" with \"faint traces\" of Native American. Online Reaction That day, reporter for the North Idaho news station KREM Taylor Viydo[2] posted a current photograph of Dolezal next a picture of her growing up (shown below, left). In the first 24 hours, the tweet gained over 1,800 retweets and 690 favorites. Shortly after, Viydo posted a follow-up tweet featuring a photograph of Dolezal's biological parents (shown below, right).     Meanwhile, many Internet users and investigative journalists discovered social media posts by Dolezal, in which she describes herself as African American, depicts her adopted step siblings as her children and falsely identifies a black man as her father (shown below).    NAACP's Response On June 12th, the NAACP[7] released a statement on the controversy, noting that \"one's racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for NAACP leadership.\"  \"One\u2019s racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for NAACP leadership. The NAACP Alaska-Oregon-Washington State Conference stands behind Ms. Dolezal\u2019s advocacy record. In every corner of this country, the NAACP remains committed to securing political, educational, and economic justice for all people, and we encourage Americans of all stripes to become members and serve as leaders in our organization.\"  Comparison to Caitlyn Jenner Also on June 12th, radio host Lenard McKelvey (aka Charlamagne Tha God) posted a tweet saying \"If Bruce Jenner can be a woman Rachel Dolezal can be black\" (shown below). In the next 12 hours, the tweet gathered upwards of 1,200 retweets and 600 favorites. That day, many debated online whether Dolezal was \"transracial\" and if it was comparable to being transgender.[5][6]    Parents' CNN Interview Meanwhile, CNN[16] broadcast an interview with Dolezal's parents, in which they indicated that Dolezal first began representing herself as African American in 2007 (shown below).  News Media Coverage In the coming days, several news media outlets published articles about the controversy, including The Daily What,[9] BuzzFeed,[10] Gawker,[11] The Washington Post,[12] The New York Times,[13] MSNBC[14] and The Guardian.[15] Resignation From NAACP On June 15th, 2015, the official Facebook[17] page for the Spokane NAACP posted a letter from Dolezal in which she announced her resignation as president due to the public focus on her racial identity.  \"It is with complete allegiance to the cause of racial and social justice and the NAACP that I step aside from the Presidency and pass the baton to my Vice President, Naima Quarles-Burnley. It is my hope that by securing a beautiful office for the organization in the heart of downtown, bringing the local branch into financial compliance, catalyzing committees to do strategic work in the five Game Changer issues, launching community forums, putting the membership on a fast climb, and helping many individuals find the legal, financial and practical support needed to fight race-based discrimination, I have positioned the Spokane NAACP to buttress this transition.\"   Today Interview On June 16th, 2015, Dolezal was interviewed on the morning talk show Today by host Matt Lauer, where she revealed \"I identify as black\" (shown below). Additionally, she claimed she started seeing herself as black as early as 5-years-old, and argued she never deceived anyone.   \"As much as this discussion has somewhat been at my expense recently, and in a very sort of viciously inhumane way come out of the woodwork, the discussion is really about what it is to be human. I hope that that can drive at the core of definitions of race, ethnicity, culture, self determination, personal agency and, ultimately, empowerment.\"  2017 Guardian Interview On February 25th, 2017, The Guardian[18] published an interview with Dolezal in which she stated that her life since the controversy brought her to the public eye has been difficult. She admits that she has been unable to find employment despite applying to over 100 jobs, is living off food stamps, and is nearly homeless. The article, coming a month in advance of Dolezal's upcoming memoir, In Full Color,[19] gives a long detail about Dolezal's life growing up in Montana under fundamentalist, abusive parents. 2017 The Stranger Article On April 19th, 2017, Ijeoma Oluo, a black woman writing for The Stranger,[20] published an article in which she interviewed Dolezal, who in October 2016 had changed her name to Nkechi Amare Diallo in order to try and get jobs. The piece was celebrated as a nuanced, final take on the Rachel Dolezal story by several media outlets, including Jezebel[21] and Gothamist.[22] Readers of the piece praised the way Oluo was able to expose Dolezal as having a pretentious view of blackness, and critical of black people who would not accept her. Readers also praised the way Oluo illustrated how the Dolezal story demonstrated a larger problem with white supremacy, pondering that because Dolezal did not benefit from perceived white privileges such as wealth and social status as a child, she felt entitled to adopt a black identity. One telling interaction was that when being photographed for the interview, Oluo suggested Dolezal sit in better lighting, which is standard journalistic practice. Dolezal took offense to this, suggesting that Oluo was trying to make Dolezal look \"lighter\" and Oluo darker. The celebration of article was covered in Twitter Moments[23] that day.    Netflix Documentary On March 7th, 2018, Netflix uploaded a clip from the 2018 documentary The Rachel Divide on YouTube. [24] The clip (shown below) received more than 65,000 views in 24 hours.  That day, Netflix formally announced the documentary.[25] The company said in a statement: \"Self-described \u201ctrans racial\u201d activist Rachel Dolezal ignited an unprecedented media storm when a local news station in Spokane, WA outed her as a white woman who had been living as the black president of the NAACP.  \"Since the controversy erupted, director Laura Brownson and team exclusively filmed with Rachel, her sons and her adopted sister Esther, capturing an intimate life story of a damaged character who lands squarely in the cross-hairs of race and identity politics in America -- and exploring how that character still provokes negative reactions from millions who see her as the ultimate example of white privilege.  \"A Netflix original documentary, The Rachel Divide is executive produced by Academy Award winner Roger Ross Williams (Life, Animated, God Loves Uganda). Online, people reacted negatively to the news of a documentary about Dolezal. Twitter[26] user @shannonmhouston tweeted the announcement with the caption, \"So @netflix just announced the Rachel Dolezal documentary. It's called #TheRachelDivide and I'm in my office screaming \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d why is this happening.\" The tweet (shown below, left) received more than 170 retweets and 500 likes in 24 hours. Twitter user @MatthewACherry tweeted,[27] \"*The opposite of God\u2019s plan starts playing*.\" The post (shown below, center) received more than 620 retweets and 1,600 likes in 24 hours. Due to the backlash, Netflix tweeted[28] a statement regarding the documentary (shown below, right). They wrote, \"To clarify one thing: Like all subjects for our documentaries, Rachel Dolezal did not receive any payment for this project. We worked with filmmakers Laura Brownson and Roger Ross Williams, who wanted to explore Dolezal\u2019s life as a microcosm for a larger conversation about race and identity. The film is focused not just on her life but on the larger conversation, including people who see her actions as the ultimate expression of white privilege.\" Twitter[29] published a Moments page about the reaction to the documentary.
