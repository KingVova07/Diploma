Appearing in films, comics and video games, the trope gained recognition in memes which parody player reactions when nothing special is hidden behind the waterfall.","In real life, the phenomenon of shallow natural caves, referred to as rock shelters, forming behind a waterfall does commonly occur as the splashing water erodes softer rock under (diagram shown below).[1] In the terms of geology, these formations do not last long as the more resistant rock forming the ceiling of the cave and the riverbed eventually collapses.","Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       Origin In real life, the phenomenon of shallow natural caves, referred to as rock shelters, forming behind a waterfall does commonly occur as the splashing water erodes softer rock under (diagram shown below).[1] In the terms of geology, these formations do not last long as the more resistant rock forming the ceiling of the cave and the riverbed eventually collapses.    The natural phenomenon found reflection in culture, particularly in adventure literature. The earliest known example of ""cave behind the waterfall"" trope in culture is Icelandic Grettis saga Ásmundarsonar, composed approximately in late 14th century.[2][3] In the saga, murderous giants live in a cave behind a waterfall. Another early example is the Hawaiian myth of the goddess Hina, who according to the legend, lived in the cave behind Rainbow Falls on the Big Island.[4] In 1592 Chinese novel Journey to the West Sun Wukong discovers a cave after jumping through a large waterfall, with him and his monkey clan later moving into that cave.[5] In literature, the trope appears in Prisoners of the Sun (1948), The Lord of the Rings (1954) and Jurassic Park (1990) among other books. In Batman comics, one of the entrances to Batman's cave lies behind a waterfall. The trope appears in The Road to El Dorado, The Incredibles, Last of the Mohicans, The Mask of Zorro and other films. In the 1995 film Behind the Waterfall, a cave hidden behind a waterfall is a key plot part. Video Games The earliest known example of a location hidden behind a waterfall in video games is action-adventure video game The Legend of Zelda, released in February 1986.

Others, such as The Guardian[3] called the film ""schlocky"" but would ""scratch a nostalgic itch for many who watched it.""

He stated in the opening post ""To the anon who asked for a reconstruction of a Pericles bust in the thread that got deleted, here you go"".    Impressed by his work, anonymous /his/ users asked him to make more reconstructions, of various other historical figures. As Tomasi posted more reconstructions, he answered a few questions about himself, and when other users asked him about Canadian cinematographer Daniel Voshart[2], Tomasi expressed his disdain for him and his ROMAN EMPEROR PROJECT[3], calling him a ""canadian cuck"" and ""an afro-centrist idiot"" who, unlike himself, was good at self-advertising. Tomasi then linked his Twitter account[4], stating that he was just getting started on the site.

In the interview with Bored Panda, he explained that he has always been interested in history, Greco-Roman and Phoenician history, in particular, and that he launched this little facial reconstruction project after seeing others do it online. He also stated  “I decided to start doing these reconstructions after coming across other reconstructions on the internet, which have obviously been done by people with absolutely no knowledge about genetics or history. Other than the fact that it is very interesting for me to bring busts to life, the main reason I started making them is basically a response to the other historically inaccurate ones I saw.""  He also stated  “I would say the biggest challenge is trying to find the right bust to work from. I always try to find busts made during the lifetime of the person I am reconstructing the face of when I can, to be as accurate as possible.”  Bored Panda's article revealed that Hannibal Barca seemed to be his favorites work at that point, and also enjoyed how his reconstruction of Cicero turned out.

The phrase developed as a meme among the Chapo Trap House fandom before branching out into a wider audience in the early 2020s.,"On May 13th, 2018, Twitter[1] user @blood_orphan posted the first tweet which used ""dudes rock"" as a means of celebrating the concept of ""dudes"" (shown below).","Top entries this week       Fluffy Ponies        Emergence (Metamorphosis)        Vinesauce        Creepy Chan (Allison Harvard)       Origin On May 13th, 2018, Twitter[1] user @blood_orphan posted the first tweet which used ""dudes rock"" as a means of celebrating the concept of ""dudes"" (shown below).    According to MEL Magazine's[2] Miles Klee, ""Dudes Rock"" originated as a semi-ironic means of subverting the ""boys will be boys"" trope that was harshly criticized during the #MeToo movement, writing:  As a fledgling in-joke, “dudes rock” was a convenient way to satirize unprovoked, red-pill-type machismo -- observing Mother’s Day by noting the supremacy of dudes, for example. But it also quickly became a shorthand for owning up to activities that, while not explicitly bad, feel intrinsically or even embarrassingly dude-like, from gaming for hours on end to growing a neckbeard to cracking open a cold one with the boys. While inundated with stories about awful, predatory men, you could still look at your unsheeted mattress and say to yourself: dudes rock.                     Spread The phrase quickly became an in-joke amongst the Chapo Trap House hosts, and by extension, their fandom. On September 10th, 2018, hosts Will Menaker and Matt Christman[3] had an exchange on Twitter where they both voiced ""dudes rock"" (shown below, left). On October 12th, the podcast E1[4] devoted an episode to defining ""Dudes Rock,"" coming up with definitions such as, ""Dude excellence is to me is like when I post a selfie, I think I’m looking fresh when I’m coming out of the 7-Eleven with like eight bags of Nacho Cheese Doritos -- I post a selfie, and any girls who fave that? Block all of ’em.""     The phrase continued seeing use over the following several years, as people began associating it with memes and news stories. For example, on January 24th, 2019, Twitter user @bobby posted a Video Games Appeal To The Male Fantasy using the phrase, gaining over 240 retweets and 1,500 likes (shown below, top). On April 4th, 2021, Twitter user @infinitsummer[5] used the phrase in reference to a Reddit post asking why so many guys came to help the user dig a hole, gaining over 8,800 retweets and 115,000 likes (shown below, bottom).
